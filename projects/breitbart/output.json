Data reported in several of the fourteen states in which there is some data\u00a0(Ohio, North Dakota, Kentucky, and Tennessee) is only partial, and in other states (California, and Indiana) covers only the most recent year, rather than the five most recent years.The Minnesota Department of Health provided Breitbart News with this statement when asked why Minnesota has reported ten times more active TB cases among refugees than any of these fourteen other states:The data you are referring to, showing 50% of the 593 foreign born residents of Minnesota diagnosed with TB arrived as refugees, represents years 2010 \u2013 2014. The majority of those refugees actually developed TB disease after being in Minnesota at least five years, and many had been in the US at least 10 years, so these are not new arrivals to the US.The presence of other medical conditions is the chief risk factor for the activation of TB disease in a person with latent infection (and remember, a third of the world has latent TB infection). These conditions include diabetes, cancers, immune suppressing medications, and renal disease. These are conditions common with the American diet and lifestyle, and new risk factors for these refugee populations. Tuberculosis can be treated with antibiotics.Often times the reason that Minnesota reports TB and other infectious diseases at higher rates than other states is because we have a stellar system of surveillance and screening. From 2010 \u2013 2014, in addition to their overseas screening, 99% of our primary refugee arrivals completed an additional health screening within 90-days of their arrival in the US. If you look at national surveillance data in 2014, states with a lower percentage of foreign-born cases arriving as refugees often have a higher percentage of unknown or missing data.During the five years between 2010 and 2014, 732 cases of active TB were diagnosed in Minnesota. Of these, 81 percent, or 593, were foreign-born. Of foreign-born cases, 50 percent, or 296, were refugees, according to \u201cThe Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in Minnesota, 2010-2014,\u201d a report published by the Minnesota Department of Health.Minnesota\u2019s 81 percent of TB cases diagnosed among foreign-born residents is significantly higher than the 66 percent of TB cases in the entire country that were diagnosed among foreign-born residents in 2015.As Breitbart News reported previously, one major factor in the sudden increase in the number of reported cases of TB in the United States in 2015 (the first time in 23 years the number of TB cases has increased) is the increase in the foreign-born population as a percentage of the total population during this period of time.Twenty-nine percent of the 593 foreign-born cases of active TB diagnosed in Minnesota, or 161, were attributed to Somali born migrants. Almost all Somali migrants to the United States have arrived under the federal refugee resettlement program.\u00a0The state of Minnesota\u2019s population is six million. Fox News reports the population of the Somali community in the state of Minnesota is 40,000, according to census data. The Star Tribune, citing \u201ccommunity leaders,\u201d reports the Somali population in the state may be as high as 70,000,\u00a0or about one percent of the state\u2019s total population.During the five years between 2010, and 2014, 20 percent of Minnesota\u2019s active TB cases (161 out of 732) were diagnosed among the one percent of the state\u2019s residents born in Somalia.The remaining 99 percent of the state\u2019s population accounted for 80 percent of Minnesota\u2019s active TB cases (471 out of 732).At an average cost of $17,000 for each case of successfully treated active TB, taxpayers of Minnesota paid an estimated $5 million to treat the 296 cases of active TB diagnosed among refugees between 2010 and 2014\u2013$3 million for the 161 Somali refugees diagnosed with active TB, and an additional $2 million to treat the 132 refugees diagnosed with active TB who were not born in Somalia.During these five years, 10,128 refugees were resettled in Minnesota, according to the Department of State\u2019s interactive website. Of these, 4,163 listed Burma as their country of origin and 3,458 listed Somalia as their country of origin.Dahir Adan, who attacked ten Americans in a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on September 17 before he was shot and killed by an armed off-duty police officer, was a Somali refugee who arrived in North Dakota in the 1990s and subsequently moved to Minnesota, where he was a resident at the time of his death.One particular note of concern from a health perspective is the number of refugees allowed to arrive in Minnesota with a pre-existing TB health classification who developed active TB after arriving in the United States.Refugees diagnosed with active infectious TB receive a Class A TB risk health classification and are not allowed to enter the country unless they receive a waiver from the Department of Homeland Security. Some refugees with a Class A TB diagnosis apparently have received such a waiver, but the Department of Homeland Security has not made public the number of such waivers it has granted.Refugees who receive\u00a0Class B1, B2, and B3 TB risk classifications in their overseas medical screenings are allowed to enter the United States.The Centers for Disease Control defines Class B1 TB risk classifications for refugees with \u201cchest radiograph findings that are consistent with tuberculosis infection without positive sputum smear or culture results for tuberculosis,\u201d and Class B2 TB risk classifications for refugees with \u201clatent tuberculosis infection.\u201dOf the 71 refugees/immigrants \u201cdiagnosed with TB within one year after arrival to U.S., Minnesota, 2010-2014,\u201d 17 percent, or 12, arrived with Class B1 TB health risk classifications, and nine percent, or six, arrived with Class B2 TB health risk classifications.\u00a0Most of the 296 refugees were diagnosed with active TB during Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State, from January 2009 to February 2013.Placement of refugees in specific states is determined by the Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migrants, in consultation with the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services.Though the Refugee Act of 1980 requires that the federal government \u201cconsult with\u201d state, local, and county governments prior to the placement of refugees in those jurisdictions, that requirement has been largely ignored by the federal government.Breitbart News previously reported that 22 percent of refugees arriving in Minnesota tested positive for latent TB infection at the time of their initial domestic medical screening.", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 2:52 PM PDT", "title": "296 Refugees Diagnosed with Active TB in Minnesota, Ten Times Any Other State; Majority Are Somalis", "tags": ["Big Government", "Immigration", "Medicine", "active TB", "Centers for Disease Control", "Minnesota", "Minnesota Department of Health", "refugees", "Somali refugees"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/13/two-hundred-ninety-six-refugees-diagnosed-active-tuberculosis-minnesota/"}, {"id": "post-5263557", "author": "Warner Todd Huston", "content": "Sioux Falls police arrested Tony Ledbetter, 45, and charged him with the vicious attack on his ex-girlfriend, a 39-year-old woman whose name has not been released, according to the Argus Leader.Police say Ledbetter severely beat the woman, slammed her head into walls and the floor, tried to choke her with his forearm, and stuffed the corner of a blanket in her mouth.

Our lawsuit is therefore against the federal government.\u00a0 We knock out the immunity, and then we can sue Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.In response, the Justice Department simply tried to dodge the issue, saying we were suing the wrong entity. Our lawyers are preparing a full-throated response, but meanwhile, the left is crowing: this little hit piece about our case is filled with hyperbole and nonsense.\u00a0The government filed a very predictable motion that, unsurprisingly, raises two issues: our standing to sue and state action.\u00a0To have standing to sue, one must show an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the action one is challenging, and that can be redressed by the court.\u00a0The government concedes in its motion that we have shown that.However, the government is arguing that the injury is from the social media giants and thus not fairly traceable to them, and therefore the injury is also not redressable by the court.\u00a0But \u201cfairly traceable\u201d does not require a direct injury from the entity one is suing.\u00a0If the action we are challenging materially increased the probability of injury, we have met that standard.\u00a0And we clearly have: as everyone knows, the only reason why social media can discriminate against us the way they do is because of the immunity granted by the federal government.The second argument that the Justice Department makes in its response to us is related in many ways to the first. The DoJ argues that there is no constitutional violation because the harm caused (the censorship) was by a private actor (social media).\u00a0That is generally true, but the Supreme Court has declared that the government is responsible when it enacts laws that change the legal relationship between two groups, including the selective withdrawal from one group of legal protections against private acts, regardless of whether the private acts can be attributed to the government \u2014 and that is precisely the situation here.The challenged congressional statute\u2014which, by definition, is an Act of \u201cCongress\u201d \u2013 alters the legal relations between us as Plaintiffs on the one hand and Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube on the other, such that these media giants are permitted to censor, with impunity, our speech based on its content and viewpoint. Consequently, state action lies in the enactment of this federal statute, regardless of whether the private acts are attributable to the government. And the resulting injury is \u201cfairly traceable\u201d to the challenged statute and \u201credressable\u201d by the relief requested. In sum, the government\u2019s motion should be denied.Our response to the government challenge notes:Through the use of Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube, anyone person with access to the Internet can become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox, and the same individual can become a pamphleteer. In sum, the Internet, particularly through social media, has become the new marketplace of ideas.Today, the impact of the Internet as a medium of worldwide human communication cannot be overstated. Social media, particularly including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are exceedingly important for worldwide human communication and thus provide important forums for that communication. Denying a person or organization access to these important social media forums based on the content and viewpoint of the person\u2019s or organization\u2019s speech on matters of public concern, as in this case, is an effective way of silencing or censoring speech and depriving the person or organization of political influence and business opportunities.Businesses that provide Internet services in California, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are subject to \u00a7 51 of the California Civil Code, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of political affiliation, religious affiliation, or political or religious beliefs, including speech expressing those beliefs. Facebook\u2019s, Twitter\u2019s, and YouTube\u2019s discrimination against Plaintiffs as set forth in the Complaint violates \u00a7 51 of the California Civil Code, but for \u00a7 230 of the CDA.By way of Section 230, the government is empowering this type of discrimination and censorship. By its own terms, this statute permits Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube \u201cto restrict access to or availability of material that [they] consider to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.\u201d But this statute does not provide any kind of objective standard for determining which speech is \u201cobjectionable.\u201dConsequently, Section 230, according to our response:Can we guarantee that the judge will agree with us?\u00a0No plaintiff can ever do that, and certainly not in the types of cases we bring.\u00a0If the district court judge dismisses our case, will we pursue this further, including possibly to the Supreme Court?\u00a0Yes.\u00a0This issue is too important.\u00a0With this power of censorship, social media could seriously influence this presidential campaign, and indeed, is already doing so.For years I have documented the outrageous bias of Facebook\u2019s speech policies. Notoriously one-sided, those who oppose jihad terror, support Israel and stand against the most brutal and extreme ideology on the face of the earth (sharia) have been systematically blocked and banned. Just last June, Facebook took down my page and blocked me after a devout Muslim opened fire on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Facebook said they took down my page because of their rule against \u201chateful, obscene, or threatening\u201d content.But it is not hateful, obscene, or threatening to oppose jihad terror such as we saw in Orlando and in so many other places. Truth is not hateful or obscene. What is hateful, obscene and threatening is that Facebook is moving to silence everyone who speaks honestly about the motivating ideology behind such attacks. To get at Facebook and the other social media giants, we have to challenge the government statute first.The left needs to handicap and shut down the opposition, because its positions do not stand up to refutation and cogent analysis. That\u2019s why the \u201cliberals\u201d are working hard to shut down free speech. Liberal, indeed. But we will continue to fight them every step of the way.Pamela Geller Lawsuit Document by Breitbart News on ScribdPamela Geller is the President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), publisher of PamelaGeller.com and author of The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration\u2019s War on America and Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance.

This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not we the people reclaim control over our government.\u201d\u201cOur Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives finally on Nov. 8,\u201d\u00a0Trump told voters, adding:Our great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world, has come upon a moment of reckoning. We\u2019ve seen it in the United Kingdom, where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deal, and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty and have destroyed many of those nations.But, the central base of world political power is right here in America, and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people. Their financial resources are virtually unlimited, their political resources are unlimited, their media resources are unmatched, and most importantly, the depths of their immorality is absolutely unlimited.Trump highlighted\u00a0the now well-documented collusion between the global special interests, corporate media, and Hillary Clinton who champions\u00a0policies to cede \u201cU.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends. and her donors.\u201d Trump slammed, what he described as, our \u201cillusion of democracy\u201d\u2013\u00a0explaining how\u00a0our\u00a0political process\u00a0is controlled \u201cby a small handful of global special interests rigging the system.\u201dTrump explained that the \u201cClinton machine,\u201d working through its arm in the corporate media, has declared \u201cwar\u201d not just against him, but against the American people,\u00a0who want to reclaim their government to represent their needs and interests, rather than simply representing the desires of corporate donors and transnational elites. Trump said:Let\u2019s be clear on one thing. The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They\u2019re a political special interest no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with a total political agenda, and the agenda is not for you, it\u2019s for themselves.And their agenda is to elect crooked Hillary Clinton at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy.\u00a0For them it\u2019s a war, and for them nothing at all is out of bounds. This is a struggle for the survival of our nation, believe me. And this will be our last chance to save it on Nov. 8, remember that.\u201cThe only thing Hillary Clinton has going for herself is the press. Without the press, she is absolutely zero,\u201d Trump said. He went on:The political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dry \u2026 The Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure.We\u2019ve seen this first hand in the WikiLeaks documents, in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends, and her donors\u2026With their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign\u2026 They knew they would throw every lie they could at me and my family and my loved ones.

I never knew it would be this vile, that it would be this bad, that it would be this vicious\u2026I will not lie to you. These false attacks are absolutely hurtful. To be lied about, to be slandered, to be smeared so publicly, and before your family that you love, is very painful. What is going on is egregious beyond any words\u2026It\u2019s reprehensible beyond description, it\u2019s totally corrupt.But, I also know that it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about all of you and it\u2019s about our country. I know that. I fully understand that. That\u2019s why I got involved. It\u2019s about all of us together as a country. It\u2019s a movement the likes of which we have never in history in this country seen before, never in history.\u201cI take all of these slings and arrows gladly for you. I take them for our movement so that we can have our country back,\u201d Trump said.Trump explained that\u00a0the only thing\u00a0powerful enough to stop the political machine is the American people, if they chose to rise up and vote against it on November 8th.He explained:The corrupt political establishment is a machine, it has no soul. I knew these false attacks would come. I knew this day would arrive; it\u2019s only a question of when. And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve.The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you. The only force strong enough to save our country is us. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American people.Trump continued:This election will determine whether we are a free nation or whether we have only the illusion of democracy, but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system, and our system is rigged. This is reality, you know it, they know it, I know it, and pretty much the whole world knows it.The establishment and their media enablers will control over this nation through means that are very well known. Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe, and morally deformed.They will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek to destroy your career and your family, they will seek to destroy everything about you, including your reputation. They will lie, lie, lie, and then again they will do worse than that, they will do whatever is necessary\u2026This is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization itself. I didn\u2019t need to do this, folks, believe me \u2014 believe me. I built a great company and I had a wonderful life. I could have enjoyed the fruits and benefits of years of successful business deals and businesses for myself and my family. Instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies, deceptions, malicious attacks \u2014 who would have thought? I\u2019m doing it because this country has given me so much, and I feel so strongly that it\u2019s my turn to give back to the country that I love\u2026This election is about every man, woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety, prosperity, and peace, so true. We will rise above the lies, the smears, the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous and very, very dishonest reporters.We will vote for the country we want. We will vote for the future we want. We will vote for the politics we want and we will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business and out of business immediately. We will vote for the special interests and say lots of luck, but you\u2019re being voted out of power.They\u2019ve betrayed our workers, they\u2019ve betrayed our borders and, most of all, they\u2019ve betrayed our freedoms. We will save our sovereign rights as a nation. We will end the politics of profit. We will end the rule of special interests. We will end the raiding of our jobs by other countries. We will end the total disenfranchisement of the American voter and the American worker.Our Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives finally on Nov. 8.", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 6:53 PM PDT", "title": "'Moment of Reckoning' -- Donald Trump: 'Our Independence Day Is at Hand, It Arrives Finally on Nov. 8th'", "tags": ["2016 Presidential Race", "Big Government", "Big Journalism", "Brexit", "Donald Trump", "Hillary Clinton"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/13/moment-reckoning-donald-trump-independence-day-hand-arrives-finally-nov-8th/"}, {"id": "post-5263552", "author": "Edwin Mora", "content": "According to the emails, Haim Saban, the network\u2019s co-owner and chairman, has counseled the Clinton campaign on its Latino strategy, and Univision\u2019s negative coverage of Republican presidential candidate Trump seems to be helping her team carry it out.Days after his 2015 presidential announcement, when Trump said some of the illegal immigrants who sneak into the United States are criminals, Saban counseled the Clinton campaign to take a tough stance against the Republican nominee.\u201cHaim thinks we are under reacting to Trump/Hispanics. Thinks we can get >>> something by standing up for Latinos or attacking R\u2019s [Republicans] for not condemning,\u201d Podesta wrote in an email sent out to members of the Clinton team on July 3, 2015.Almost immediately, Jennifer Palmieri, a former White House staffer who now serves as communications director for the Clinton campaign, responded, \u201cHaim is right \u2013 we should be jamming this all the time.\u201dPredictably, Univision\u2019s news programs, especially anchor Jorge Ramos, have since characterized Trump\u2019s comments as \u201canti-immigrant\u201d every chance they get, putting all Latinos, both legal and illegal, into one box. The Republican candidate was actually referring to illegal immigrants.In the July 3, 2015, email thread about Haim urging the campaign to go after Trump, prominent DREAMer and immigration activist Lorella Praeli , who now serves as the Clinton campaign\u2019s Latino Outreach Director, sent out a message of her own, saying:Alex, who works for Haim, called a few minutes ago.

Bill Richardson a \u201cdick.\u201dTwo days after the email was sent, Richardson, doubtless oblivious to Podesta\u2019s remarks, endorsed Hillary Clinton, whose trustworthiness remains a drag on her run for president.Richardson was the first Hispanic Democrat to seek the presidency of the United States in 2008, along with Hillary.Univision has yet to mention the August 2015 email, which was posted Wednesday, despite the fact that it berated Latinos and a Latino leader.Although Podesta has suggested some of the emails have been fabricated by Russian hackers, \u201cthe Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party have declined to certify the emails\u2019 authenticity,\u201d reports McClatchy DC, later adding, \u201cBut Clinton herself indicated they were authentic when she recalled at Sunday\u2019s presidential debate the details of a speech she\u2019d given that was among the emails.\u201d3.

And if even 10 percent of that group was to show up and vote this year, it could easily change the outcome in the important swing states.\u201dSracic\u2014who frankly admits he obsesses over opinion polls\u2014wonders whether these voters are even represented in the endless presidential surveys: \u201cIf people aren\u2019t registered voters, they won\u2019t be picked up by most polls. If they are registered voters but don\u2019t normally vote, they may be eliminated by \u2018likely voter\u2019 screens pollsters use.\u201d Romney lost Pennsylvania in 2012 by about 300,000 votes out of about 5.5 million cast; in Ohio, he lost by less than 200,000. \u201cSo bringing new people in can make a difference,\u201d Sracic said.Potentially more significant, however, are those voters who \u201cflip\u201d\u2014Sracic\u2019s second category. \u201cRemember,\u201d he said, \u201ctaking a Democratic voter and having them vote Republican is both a +1 and a -1. In other words, if Romney lost Pennsylvania by 300,000 voters, all you have to do [this time] is flip slightly more than 150,000 votes.\u201d Between Ohio and Pennsylvania, if approximately 225,000 voters (out of the 11 million who are expected on Election Day) switch parties, they could tip the entire election.\u201cWriters such as National Review\u2019s correspondent Kevin Williamson have suggested that people who live in communities that are experiencing economic hard times should just pack up and move somewhere else,\u201d said Sracic.He believes that Williamson and others like him actually have a very narrow understanding of what constitutes and promotes happiness and wellbeing: \u201cPeople need jobs and enough money to survive, but they also desire community. Friends and family are important. When we talk about \u2018creative destruction\u2019 as being part of a vibrant national economy, we sometime miss the real damage that is done to the networks that sustain us.\u201dIf nearly everyone moves away, who is going to take care of mom and dad as they age?

The Telegraph\u2018s natural readership would have hated this of course: but where else could they go?Despite the awfulness of their SJW-lite politics, I got to know and like some of those SJW-lite scribblers. Sure they kept sabotaging my decent stories with their half-baked crap based on press releases from Greenpeace but because I\u2019ve got kids of my own I tend to give the youth a lot of leeway.Tom Chivers, for example. He\u2019s a lovely bloke, family man, now\u00a0a science writer at Buzzfeed and, I tell you what, he doesn\u2019t half do a jolly good light feature about sharks.As a shark buff myself \u2013 like him, I\u2019ve cage dived with great whites off South Africa \u2013 I totally recommend this shark identification quiz he did the other day. It\u2019s perfect Buzzfeed. Indeed it\u2019s what Buzzfeed was meant for: listicles and shit.Where Tom and I must part company, now as ever, is on the subject of climate change. I\u2019ve monstered him on this subject before but\u00a0he won\u2019t back down because he\u2019s got a science degree \u2013 combined with the cocksure arrogance of youth and instinctively lefty politics \u2013 and thinks the facts are on his side.Here\u2019s his latest effort, titled \u201cHere\u2019s What\u2019s Going On Behind Those \u201cHottest Day/Month/Year Headlines\u201dDoes young Tom go on to write about the data-fudging, noble-cause corruption, groupthink, institutional malfeasance, pal review and scaremongering which have brought about all those \u201cHottest Day/Month/Year Headlines\u201d?Of course he doesn\u2019t. Instead, he rings up three of the climate scientists currently growing fat on the climate science gravy train by promoting the accepted climate science narrative and listens uncritically while they explain to him how yes, global warming really is as bad as the scientists are saying, in fact it\u2019s probably worse, much much worse\u2026Tom hates homeopathy. But what he\u2019s done here is the equivalent of calling three homeopaths and getting them to confirm that\u00a0diluting stuff makes it more powerful and that arnica\u2019s particularly good for bruising.Enough bitching: what about Tom\u2019s science?Well, this has now been pretty effectively\u00a0demolished by Paul Homewood, under the winning headline \u201cMore Hottest Year Evah Nonsense.\u201dDo read Homewood\u2019s post in full. It\u2019s an invaluable put down not just to Chivers\u2019s Buzzfeed article but also to all the myriad other articles you see on this subject at places like the BBC, The New York Times, WaPo, MSNBC, The Guardian, ABC and so on because it explains, very simply and clearly, why the current swathe of \u201cHottest Year Evah\u201d stories are based on flawed science.Flaw Number One:Surface temperature datasets are so flawed (Urban Heat Island effect; poor siting issues; large areas of the world where there is no coverage) as to be untrustworthy. Satellite data don\u2019t show nearly the same extreme warming trend: this year\u2019s high temperatures, the result of a\u00a0strong\u00a0El Nino, are roughly the same of those as of the (similarly strong)\u00a0El Nino of 1998.Flaw Number Two:The Warmists have vanished the Pause, just like they tried to do with the Medieval Warming PeriodI love this new scary chart, produced by one of Chivers\u2019s alarmists. But does it bear any relation to observed\u00a0reality?Flaw Number Three:Why aren\u2019t the alarmists looking at ENSO, which \u2013 as Homewood notes \u2013 offers a much better explanation of climate than man-made global warming theory?The real story behind temperature trends since 1979, the start of the satellite era, concerns the changing pattern of ENSO, the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation, described by NOAA as the most important coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon to cause global climate variability on interannual time scales.We\u2019ve currently been experiencing a run of strong El Ninos. When these give way to a run of strong La Ninas, we can expect temperatures to drop below average. I\u2019m not looking forward to this. I\u2019d much rather have abnormally warm weather than abnormally cold weather.Here\u2019s the sad thing, though. Lots and lots of earnest\u00a0liberal-lefty kids are going to read Chivers\u2019s Buzzfeed post and go \u2013 \u201cWow! Science-y scientists sciencing the shit out of climate science, in a piece with lots of science in it, written by a guy with a science degree and a tag that says \u2018science writer\u201d \u2013\u00a0and have all their half-baked convictions about the reality of man-made global warming confirmed.None of them are going to come anywhere near here \u2013 nor anywhere near Homewood\u2019s blog. So the generational and ideological divide on the subject of climate change is doomed to grow wider and ever more bitter.Just as well, isn\u2019t it, that when it all seriously starts kicking off, we red-meat conservatives are going to be better skilled in weapon usage and more heavily armed than the kind of tofu-eating metropolitan dweebs who read crap like Buzzfeed?", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 1:02 AM PDT", "title": "Debunked: Another Buzzfeed 'Hottest Year Evah' Story", "tags": ["Big Journalism", "Breitbart London", "Environment", "Buzzfeed", "Climate Change", "El Ni\u00f1o", "Global Warming", "hottest year evah", "Paul Homewood", "sharks", "SJW", "Telegraph", "Tom Chivers"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/10/13/debunked-another-buzzfeed-hottest-year-evah-story/"}, {"id": "post-5251002", "author": "AWR Hawkins", "content": "Meanwhile, gun-controlled Chicago is nearing 600 homicides for 2016 alone.According to the NYT, \u201canalysis\u201d from George Soros-funded Center for American Progress shows that \u201cgun fatalities in states with weaker laws are three times as high as in those states with tougher restrictions.\u201d Based on this, the paper calls for voters in \u201cCalifornia, Maine, Nevada, and Washington\u201d to support gun control measures that will be on the ballot next month.The NYT does not mention that California is already one of the most gun-controlled states in the union. It has comprehensive background checks \u2014 which eliminate a \u201cgun show loophole\u201d or \u201conline loophole\u201d \u2014 a waiting period on gun purchases, firearm registration, and gun confiscation laws, yet it also had the May 23, 2014, Santa Barbara attack, the December 2, 2015, San Bernardino firearm-based terror attack, the June 1, 2016, murder-suicide on the gun-free UCLA campus, and the October 8, 2016, high-profile shooting deaths of two police officers in Palm Springs.Washington state also has comprehensive background checks \u2014 the very checks Hillary Clinton, Gabby Giffords, and Michael Bloomberg-funded gun control groups pursue as key to American safety. Yet our nation\u2019s most recent mass shooting took place in Burlington, Washington, on September 23. Five innocent lives were taken in Cascades Mall. On July 30, three innocents were shot and killed at a house party just north of Seattle, and in late February, the AP reported a gunman killed four people then himself in Belfair, Washington.Ironically, much of the momentum for gun control continues to come from the December 14, 2012, attack on Sandy Hook Elementary. Even now, new laws are being pushed under the guise of preventing such an attack, and the NYT says a total of eight states have passed \u201cuniversal background checks\u201d \u2014 the same thing as comprehensive background checks \u2014 as a way to keep a Sandy Hook-like attack from occurring. But if the examples of California and Washington state teach us anything, it is that comprehensive background checks offer no hindrance to determined attackers.In fact, it is worth remembering that Connecticut was ranked 5th in the nation for most stringent gun controls when the attack on Sandy Hook occurred. The Brady Campaign Against Gun Violence lauded Connecticut for 5th \u201ctoughest\u201d laws in 2011, and in 2012, Adam Lanza circumvented every one of those laws by stealing his guns and carrying out a heinous crime in a gun-free zone.Nevertheless, the NYT\u00a0contends that more gun control makes us safer.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

And their accounts echo those of other women who have previously come forward, like Temple Taggart, a former Miss Utah, who said that Mr. Trump kissed her on the mouth more than once when she was a 21-year-old pageant contestant.In a phone interview on Tuesday night, a highly agitated Mr. Trump denied every one of the women\u2019s claims.Read the rest of the story here.A statement from Jason Miller, Senior Communications Advisor for the Trump campaign, reads:This entire article is fiction, and for the New York Times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous. To reach back decades in an attempt to smear Mr. Trump trivializes sexual assault, and it sets a new low for where the media is willing to go in its efforts to determine this election.It is absurd to think that one of the most recognizable business leaders on the planet with a strong record of empowering women in his companies would do the things alleged in this story, and for this to only become public decades later in the final month of a campaign for president should say it all.Further, the Times story buries the pro-Clinton financial and social media activity on behalf of Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, reinforcing that this truly is nothing more than a political attack.

Right now, all that matters is stopping Trump.The same media that are pretending to consider the use of a bad word equivalent to rape don\u2019t give a fig about real rape, real sexual assault, real whoring, even real homicide, depending on who did it.JFK was an STD-infected drug addict who cavorted with whores at the White House, but the media ferociously hid all this from the public, publishing fairy-tale versions of his presidency as \u201cCamelot.\u201dAnd what happened to the 11-year rule? Trump said the word \u201cp*ssy\u201d 11 years ago, in a secretly recorded conversation. Eleven years before Sen. Teddy Kennedy ran for president, he killed a girl \u2014 but he ran, not only without apology, but, indeed, as the Conscience of the Democratic Party.Throughout 2009, good, decent Americans who happened to oppose Obamacare were called the name of a gay sex act hundreds of times on TV \u2014 and that was just on MSNBC. CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper made the reference explicit when he giggled, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk when you\u2019re tea-bagging.\u201dAmong the people using this sexual slur were distinguished members of Congress such as U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez and Rep. Barney Frank. Were they fit to hold office?Going way, way, way back to a few weeks ago, the same media gasping in horror at \u201cp*ssy\u201d sure didn\u2019t mind my being called a c*nt repeatedly on a Comedy Central broadcast. And when I say \u201cdidn\u2019t mind,\u201d I mean they thought it was awesome.But saying \u201cp*ssy\u201d 11 years ago is over the line.Cut the crap, media.A few years ago, Sen. Al Franken joked on a Comedy Central roast about producer Rob Reiner butt-f*cking his children. Does Hillary think he\u2019s fit to be a U.S. senator? Is he fit enough for the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, but not the Senate Finance Committee?None of these were leaks of secretly recorded conversations \u2014 considered a hanging offense in the Clinton years. These vulgarities were intentionally, publicly broadcast by the same media that, today, pretend to need smelling salts after hearing \u201cp*ssy.\u201dAt least this new puritanical standard explains why rappers like Jay Z are banned from the White House. Wait \u2014 what?Perhaps realizing their Victorian virgin act wasn\u2019t cutting it, the media turned to their Pretend We Don\u2019t Understand English method of argument, and claimed that Trump was confessing to having committed a \u201csexual assault\u201d!Trump said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab \u2019em by the pussy. You can do any of that. (Laughter.)\u201d Journalists turned this into \u201csexual assault\u201d by being literal on the \u201cgrab\u201d part, non-figurative on the \u201cyou\u201d part \u2014 and on the \u201cthey let you do it\u201d part? Stone, cold deaf.If \u201cthey let you do it,\u201d it\u2019s not an assault.Like most of Trump\u2019s bragging, his loutish boast was not intended to be taken seriously, nor was it. Far from whipping out his pencil and carefully taking notes, \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d\u2018s Billy Bush laughed. The gist of what Trump was saying is that \u2014 hold onto your hats! \u2014 women like to sleep with celebrities! I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard that before.At least we\u2019re back to the media pretending to care about sexual assault \u2014 until further notice.This is the same media that ran interference for an\u00a0actual sexual predator\u00a0in the White House, ignoring Bill Clinton\u2019s serial pants-dropping, groping and raping for nearly a decade, while gleefully vilifying his accusers, and would have been happy to continue if Bill Richardson had become president. Clinton talking about p*ssy was one of his more dignified moments, proudly attested to by his friend Vernon Jordan in a nationally broadcast interview with Mike Wallace.In the pages of The New York Times, feminist icon Gloria Steinem announced the \u201cone-free grope\u201d rule, specially developed for\u00a0the Clinton era.Former Time magazine correspondent Nina Burleigh said of Clinton, \u201cI would be happy to give him a bl*w job just to thank him for keeping abortion legal.\u201dTime magazine\u2019s Margaret Carlson said Linda Tripp had \u201clost membership in the family of man\u201d for secretly tape-recording Monica Lewinsky. Tripp kept the recordings not for something so exalted as stopping Trump, but to protect herself from a charge of perjury.Even when the law began to close in on the horny hick \u2014 midway through the second term he won because of the media\u2019s heroic self-censorship \u2014 the rest of us had to spend a year listening to liberals say \u201cGuys like bl*w jobs,\u201d \u201cEverybody does it\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s move on.\u201dWhen Clinton was credibly accused of rape by Juanita Broaddrick, NBC strategically held the story \u2014 until a week after the Senate had voted in the rapist\u2019s impeachment trial. All the public could do was helplessly sport \u201cFree Lisa Myers\u201d buttons, referring to the investigative reporter who got the interview.Explaining NBC\u2019s incomprehensible decision to hold its own investigative report, Myers told Broaddrick: \u201cThe good news is you\u2019re credible. The bad news is that you\u2019re very credible.\u201dAt least NBC ran the story eventually. The name \u201cJuanita Broaddrick\u201d never crossed the lips of \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d anchor Dan Rather.Asked by FNC\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly why he never got around to mentioning that the commander in chief was, more likely than not, a rapist, Rather said, \u201cWhen the charge has something to do with somebody\u2019s private sex life, I would prefer not to run any of it.\u201dSo according to our media, committing a rape is \u201csomebody\u2019s private sex life,\u201d but using a bad word is rape.Poor Billy Bush has to be fired from NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show so the media can pretend that Trump\u2019s using bawdy language is a very, very serious offense.Meanwhile, Billy\u2019s ex-president uncle and cousin openly fraternize with the rapist. The second President Bush calls Bill Clinton his \u201cbrother from another mother\u201d and praises Clinton\u2019s \u201ccharacter\u201d \u2014 something even Clinton\u2019s defenders never did with a straight face.Now the networks are holding casting calls for some loon willing to falsely accuse Trump of sexual assault, so they can hype it like the Duke lacrosse case, Mattress Girl and Rolling Stone\u2019s fraternity rape.

I\u2019m out the first two days of next week but will make sure to defend her when things get further along in the nomination process.\u201dBowles later forwarded the e-mails to Podesta, who thanked him, writing, \u201cThis will help a lot and I think at the end of the day most of these Senators will come through\u2026 At any rate, thanks for coming thru as you always do. Love to Crandall and hope you\u2019ll come to the Casa Podesta upcoming dinner to celebrate Sylvia\u2019s swearing in.\u201dBurwell has faced much controversy since being named secretary of Health and Human Services, a position she continues to hold, primarily because of her role as the chief defender of the Affordable Care Act.Quick, who is also the anchorwoman of CNBC\u2019s On the Money, is married to Matt Quayle, an influential executive producer at CNBC. She has previously worked as a reporter for The Wall Street Journal and as a columnist for Fortune.CNBC moderator Becky Quick, Jim Brett, President of West Elm, Karen Appleton, founder of Box.org, John Chambers, Executive Chairman for Cisoc, Erica Kochi, Senior Advisor to UNICEF Executive Director on Innovation & Co-founder, UNICEF Innovation and John McFarlane, Chairman of Barclay\u2019s take part in a panel discussion during the third day of the 2015 Clinton Global Initiative\u2019s Annual Meeting at the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers on September 28, 2015 in New York City. (JP Yim/Getty Images)Quick\u2019s pledge to protect Burwell on CNBC comes hours and days after other reports of media bias have surfaced, also thanks to e-mails discovered through WikiLeaks\u2019 Podesta e-mail database.Some examples of that bias include CNBC correspondent John Harwood\u2019s close relationship with Podesta; evidence CNN contributor Donna Brazile secretly e-mailed debate questions to Clinton prior to a debate with Bernie Sanders; and one e-mail showing Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri editing a New York Times reporter\u2019s story on an interview he had with Clinton.It is undeniable WikiLeaks\u2019 Podesta e-mails prove many in the mainstream media cannot be trusted to report fairly or accurately. Americans must realize this and seek sources of information that will present facts fairly and honestly. This doesn\u2019t mean media outlets must be devoid of opinion journalism\u2014that\u2019s probably impossible to accomplish in today\u2019s world\u2014but it does mean people should only trust\u00a0hard news\u00a0reporters who aren\u2019t colluding closely with politicians and their closest advisers.Is that really too much to ask for?Justin Haskins (jhaskins@heartland.org) is executive editor of The Heartland Institute.", "date": "12 Oct 2016, 2:23 PM PDT", "title": "WikiLeaks: CNBC Host Rebecca Quick Promises to \u2018Defend\u2019 Obama Appointee", "tags": ["Big Government", "Big Journalism", "WikiLeaks", "CNBC", "Department of Health and Human Services", "Donna Brazile", "John Podesta", "Rebecca Quick", "Squawk Box", "Sylvia Burwell", "WikiLeaks"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/10/12/wikileaks-cnbc-host-rebecca-quick-promises-defend-obama-appointee/"}, {"id": "post-5251297", "author": "Liam Deacon", "content": "Mrs. Mensch runs the Rupert Murdoch-backed blog Heat Street, which claims to stand against identity politics and what it labels \u201csocial justice warriors\u201d under the slogan \u201cno safe spaces.\u201dHowever, its editor in chief, Mrs. Mensch, was caught writing a campaign advertisement script for the Democratic candidate \u2013 a woman who has traded off identity politics and social justice warrior politics.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Hillary Clinton \u2014 Brazile allegedly sent an email titled \u201cFrom time to time I get the questions in advance,\u201d to Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton\u2019s campaign communications director. The email provided a question about the death penalty that she said \u201cworries me about HRC.\u201dThe question asked:19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That\u2019s 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?Palmieri responded to Brazile\u2019s email with, \u201cYes, it is one she gets asked about.\u00a0Not everyone likes her answer but can share it.\u201d She then signaled Betsaida Alcantara, who is Clinton\u2019s director of media planning, asking her to send Brazile Clinton\u2019s answer on the death penalty.In her statement on Tuesday, Brazile did not directly assert that the email was fake\u00a0but\u00a0suggested that Russia might have \u201cforged\u201d the emails in the WikiLeaks documents:We are in the process of verifying the authenticity of these documents because it is common for Russia to spread misinformation and forge documents, but we cannot bow down to Putin\u2019s wish and allow foreign actors to try and divid or country wight he hope of affecting the outcome on Election Day. There is too much at stake.Barbara Levin, CNN\u2019s vice president of communications, also denied sharing the town hall questions with Brazile in advance.

But CNN flatly denied any coordination. \u201cWe have never, ever given a town hall question to anyone beforehand,\u201d a CNN spokeswoman said.Martin did not deny sharing information with Brazile. Instead, when asked by CNNMoney, he said \u201cmy questions were shared with my executive producer and several members of my TV One team.\u201dWhen asked in a followup question if he would explicitly rule out any sharing of questions with Brazile, Martin did not respond.\u2026A similarly-worded question was read by Martin at the town hall the next day [March 13, 2016]. He introduced an exonerated former death row inmate who asked Clinton about her view on the matter.That\u00a0questioner was named Ricky Jackson \u2014 a man who was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1975 and served 39 years on death row in an Ohio prison\u00a0but was later exonerated:Brazile\u2019s statement also took the opportunity to criticize Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump:Our intelligence community has made it clear that the Russian government is responsible for the cyberattacks aimed at interfering with our election, and that WikiLeaks is part of that effort. This revelation should deeply trouble all Americans in both parties. And yet, Donald Trump continues to deny that Russia is behind these attempts to meddle with our electoral process and cheer on these efforts to undermine our democracy.This is the same man who called for more Russian cyber-espionage against us, who has extensive business ties to Russia, and who regularly coddles Vladimir Putin by praising his leadership and refusing to call him out. I am deeply disappointed that the Republican leaders of the party of Reagan are publicly using information illegally obtained by the Russians, because the national security of our country should not be a partisan issue.Trump tweeted a response to the WikiLeaks emails revealing that Brazile had allegedly provided the \u201cworrisome\u201d death penalty question to Clinton\u2019s camp ahead of time:Wow, @CNN Town Hall questions were given to Crooked Hillary Clinton in advance of big debates against Bernie Sanders.

Not only did the brothers unilaterally decide to retain the law firm Paul, Weiss, whose internal investigation facilitated Ailes\u2019s exit, but they are now playing a pivotal role in persuading the network\u2019s brightest star, Megyn Kelly, whose contract expires in July 2017, to re-sign.Kelly and the younger Murdochs have been close for years. They are all in their early-to-mid-40s, and can espouse views that can be out of lockstep with the network\u2019s hard-right narrative. Kelly, who spoke to lawyers from Paul, Weiss during their investigation, was indeed a pivotal figure in the Ailes ouster. And throughout it all, according to a person familiar with the matter, Kelly spoke multiple times with Murdoch family members. \u201cLachlan was the one who talked to her throughout this entire ordeal,\u201d this person told me earlier this summer. \u201cJames loves Megyn,\u201d this person continued. \u201cHe believes she\u2019s a big part of the future of this channel.\u201d According to a person close to Kelly, she has dined at the younger Murdoch\u2019s homes twice in the past several months.This person close to Kelly explained that the younger Murdochs appear to be doing everything in their power to keep the anchor. (Another person familiar with the internal operations of Fox News also noted that any negotiations would likely begin now, before the election, and well in advance of her contract\u2019s expiration.) Kelly, who The L.A. Times has reported earns around $10 million a year at Fox News, could possibly command double that amount, a figure more in line with what her in-house rival and nemesis Bill O\u2019Reilly reportedly earns. But the person close to Kelly told me it was \u201cpremature\u201d to say that Kelly was staying at Fox News. \u201cI don\u2019t think she knows what she is going to do,\u201d this person continued.

Less public is the fact that O\u2019Reilly and Sean Hannity haven\u2019t talked for years either. (Kelly and Hannity recently had their own kerfuffle, of course.) The internal rivalries within Fox News were often fueled by Ailes, but they were also controlled by him, too. And with him gone, they seem to have only gotten worse. Last month, O\u2019Reilly took a night off, and his replacement garnered lower ratings than his competition on both MSNBC and CNN. It\u2019s a sign of just how much the Murdochs have to manage as they try to keep Fox News in its dominant position. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s contract, too, is up in 2017, and as far as I know, he hasn\u2019t attended any dinner parties at the Murdoch sons\u2019 homes lately.Read the rest here.", "date": "12 Oct 2016, 6:07 AM PDT", "title": "Vanity Fair: Murdoch Sons See Megyn Kelly as \u2018Brightest Star\u2019 and \u2018Future\u2019 of Fox News", "tags": ["Big Journalism", "Bill O'Reilly", "James Murdoch", "Lachlan Murdoch", "Megyn Kelly", "Roger Ailes", "Rupert Murdoch", "Sean Hannity"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/10/12/vanity-fair-murdoch-sons-see-megyn-kelly-brightest-star-future-fox-news/"}, {"id": "post-5246207", "author": "Dustin Stockton", "content": "The Eilperin article was published in March 2015, and was titled, \u201cObama promised to curb the influence of lobbyists.

Can you just make sure he gets this note over the weekend?Podesta asked Benenati to find out \u201cwhere she is coming from on this?\u201d Benenati replied to Podesta, saying he would reach out and then shortly after, emailed him another message from Eilperin with the exact quote from the story, and her request to \u201clet me know if there are any issues with it\u201d.\u201cAnd the liberal think tank Center for American Progress\u2013which former White House senior counselor John D.

Having lost the fight over gay marriage, the state\u2019s religious right decided that the sacred institution of wedlock was once again under attack \u2014 this time, by devious immigrants.\u00a0Undocumented workers\u00a0and even\u00a0terrorists\u00a0had newly discovered they could exploit Louisiana\u2019s marriage laws to gain citizenship, legislators claimed, leading to a supposed epidemic of \u201cmarriage fraud.\u201dThe response? Make it more difficult for immigrants to get married, of course.So, as of this year, any foreign-born person wanting to get married in Louisiana must produce both an unexpired visa (even though a federal court has\u00a0ruled that marriage licenses cannot be denied based on immigration status), as well as, somewhat inexplicably, a birth certificate.The Washington Post columnist admits the \u201claw has indeed placed marriage off-limits to immigrants in the country illegally,\u201d as it was designed to, but goes on to say that refugees are adversely impacted as well.Louisiana resident Out Xanamane, the columnist notes, is one of many apparently who could not get married in the state because he did not have a birth certificate, citing his arrival in the 1980s from Savannakhet, Laos.Xanamane went to Alabama to get married, as The Washington Post columnist writes, \u201cIt\u2019s not clear whether the champions of the Louisiana law intended to make marriage less accessible.\u201dThe columnist says the law is an \u201canti-immigrant\u201d reaction, though it is successfully keeping illegal immigrants from taking advantage of state marriage laws to anchor themselves locally.Louisiana State Rep. Valerie Hodges (R-LA) proposed the legislation, not to target refugees and immigrants, but to incentivize would-be illegal immigrants to pursue the naturalization process.John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

One month to go and these vicious cowards jump ship?John McCain, Mark Kirk, Kelly Ayotte, George Pataki \u2013 RINOs who never stood up for conservative principles are the Republicans disavowing Trump now. The GOP will not recover from this. We had to swallow their failures \u2014 RINO McCain, spineless weak sister Mitt Romney \u2014 and we did.

And the elites would rather set our house on fire than back the people\u2019s candidate.If the elite right went after the opposition the way they\u2019ve gone after Trump, they wouldn\u2019t be limping their way to oblivion.The uproar over Trump\u2019s remarks is manufactured and opportunistic outrage. For example, I was actually surprised by the decorum in Trump\u2019s conversation. He was respectful of the married woman\u2019s refusal. He was surprised that if you\u2019re famous, you can get all the sex you want. He was unashamedly heterosexual in his desires. He wanted to grab p\u2014y, not force someone\u2019s head \u201cdown\u201d a la Bill Clinton. He appreciates \u201cbeautiful\u201d and wants to kiss her face, not have her immediately perform oral sex a la Bill Clinton, and he wants to be pleasing to her with Tic Tacs for his breath \u2014 very considerate. A pass, a kiss, is not rape. For that, you\u2019d have to ask Juanita Broaddrick.The gross betrayal is not Trump\u2019s alpha male banter, but these turncoats in the party. Did they ever take such a defiant stand against the treasonous actions of Obama and his running dogs? Trump is an alpha male. Gutless, weak metrosexuals like Barack Obama have almost destroyed America, and now the world is in chaos because of their actions.

This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we\u2019re facing today. We are losing our jobs, we\u2019re less safe than we were eight years ago, and Washington is totally broken. Hillary Clinton and her kind have run our country into the ground.I\u2019ve said some foolish things, but there\u2019s a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.There is no comparison between Trump and the Clintons. None. Not only has Bill Clinton abused women. Hillary Clinton routinely abuses her secret service detail, once screaming at an agent: \u201cIf you want to remain on this detail, get your f***ing ass over here and grab those bags!\u201d When one said to her, \u201cGood morning, ma\u2019am,\u201d she replied: \u201cF**k off! It\u2019s enough that I have to see you ****-kickers every day, Just do your G*damn job and keep your mouth shut.\u201dThe selective outrage is astonishing. The liberals corrupted the culture. No one cares. Trump looks cool. They live by the sword and they will die by the sword. All of a sudden the liberals are prudish? Barack Obama says, \u201cGotta have them ribs and p\u2014y too,\u201d and crickets don\u2019t even bother to chirp. On the same day that the \u201cshocked\u201d Washington Post released the naughty Trump video, they ran a front-of-the-book news story how cyber-policing hurts prostitutes.Hollywood, too?

The thieves \u2014 who remain at large \u2014 reportedly stole $5.6 million worth of jewelry, including a diamond ring given to Kardashian by her husband Kanye West said to be worth $4 million.AFP reported that Kardashian was \u201cbadly shaken but physically unharmed\u201d after the incident, during which she was reportedly bound and gagged.It is noteworthy to contrast Kardashian\u2019s approach to her personal security with her campaign for more gun control for law-abiding citizens; the former relies on good guys with guns to keep her safe, while the latter makes it harder for good guys to get guns to keep themselves safe.After\u00a0the June 17, 2015, firearm-based attack on Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Kardashian voiced support\u00a0for\u00a0\u201cstricter legislation to prevent mass shootings.\u201d The\u00a0Daily Mail quoted her saying, \u201cI\u2019m not the type to have them (guns) in my house, they scare me so much,\u201d yet she did not hesitate to push for increased gun control measures as something she believed would \u201cchange the world.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not really a gun person, and we do not have strict enough gun control laws,\u201d she reportedly said.Kardashian appeared to have\u00a0missed the fact that gun laws in Paris are among the most strict\u00a0in the world, but this did not prevent terrorists from acquiring guns and killing 12 people in the January 7, 2015 attack on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Moreover, on November 13, 2015 \u2014 months after Kardashian described gun control as something that could \u201cchange the world\u201d \u2014 armed terrorists shot and killed 130 people in gun-controlled Paris.On June 12, the day an attacker shot and killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Kardashian suggested the US needs stronger laws to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists.\u00a0 She tweeted:\u00a0\u201cUnder current federal law people on terror watch lists can legally buy guns \u2013 this is called the Terror Gap.\u201d But Kardashian apparently missed the fact that the Orlando attacker was not on a terror watch list; therefore, including the terror watch list in background checks would not have hindered, much less prevented, the Orlando attack.As recently as August 5, 2016, Kardashian and her sisters Kourtney and Khloe\u00a0met with family members of gun violence victims at an event organized\u00a0by the Michael Bloomberg-funded Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety. Two months later, Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint while in Paris, a city with gun control that exceeds the laws\u00a0Kardashian has advocated for in the United States.Kardashian will apparently\u00a0surround herself with more good guys with guns for safety, but has not recanted her efforts to make it harder for good guys to acquire guns with which to defend themselves.\u00a0AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

After Clinton calls on Trump to release his taxes, Trump says \u00a0people like Warren Buffet and George Soros took \u201cmassive deductions.\u201d He says he would be \u201cvery proud\u201d to release his taxes after his routine audit is done.9:48: Clinton now claims that her comments about private/public positions was in reference to Lincoln.

Trump says drugs are pouring through our Southern border \u201cat a record clip\u201d and Clinton doesn\u2019t understand the border and wants amnesty.

Raddatz transitions to the question from a voter about whether it is okay for a politician to be two-faced.]9:43: Raddatz helps Clinton even in her questioning, saying \u201cwe know you want tougher vetting.\u201d Again, the moderators are like rasslin\u2019 announcers doing their best to make Clinton get \u201cover\u201d with the audience while trying to turn Trump into the \u201cheel\u201d that that audience hates. Is Trump skilled enough to be the anti-hero and heel that rasslin\u2019 crowds started to love in the Attitude Era like Stone Cold Steve Austin?9:41: Clinton says \u201cwe are not at war with Islam.\u201d \u00a0She says she wants a country where citizens like you are welcome just like everyone else. Raddatz piles on, again pressing Trump on his Muslim ban. She asks if Trump supports the Muslim ban. Trump says if he had been president, Captain Kahn would have been alive today because he would not have gone into Iraq like Clinton. He calls him an \u201cAmerican hero.\u201d Raddatz keeps grilling Trump. The moderators have hardly interrogated Clinton tonight. Trump keeps trying to explain his \u201cextreme vetting\u201d program and says Clinton wants more Syrian refugees. \u201cThe great Trojan Horse of all time,\u201d he says. Trump says he doesn\u2019t want hundreds of thousands of people from Syria coming in when we don\u2019t know nothing about their values or their love for our country.\u00a09:39: Clinton thanks the questioner for asking the question. She says there have been \u201cdivisive\u201d and \u201cdark\u201d things said about Muslims. She brings up Trump\u2019s attacks on the Kahn family. Clinton talks about the country\u2019s famous Muslims and says we just lost one in Muhammad Ali. Clinton says it\u2019s short-sighted and \u201cdangerous\u201d for Trump to be engaged in demagogic comments about Muslims.[These are \u201cUNDECIDED\u201d voters?]9:37: Muslim questioner asks Trump about Islamophobia. \u201cYou\u2019re right about islamophobia, and that\u2019s a shame,\u201d Trump says, again showing that he wants to appease whomever is speaking to him. But he says we have to get Muslims to report what they see in their communities. Trump now says Clinton and Obama won\u2019t use the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d and \u201cbefore you solve it, you have to say the name.\u201d9:36: Cooper grills Trump on specifics re: Obamacare/health \u00a0(he wants to know how he would get insurance companies to insure uninsured people without a mandate) care while Hillary Clinton smirks as Trump is under fire.9:32: Trump says Obamacare is a disaster and is only getting worse. He says Obamacare is expensive for those who have it and unbelievably expensive for the country. He says we have to replace it with something that is less expensive and words. He again talks about getting rid of the lines around the states. He says Clinton wants a single-payer plan like Canada and has been after this for years. He says Obamacare is just the first step.[Trump did not mention that Bill Clinton called it crazy. Anderson Cooper had to do that. Again, lack of preparation showing for Trump.]9:29: Questioner asks about Obamacare. Cooper tries to give Clinton the first bite at the apple. After Trump starts to answer, Clinton says let him take it. Trump says he\u2019s a gentleman so he will allow Clinton to answer. She says what Donald would have said was that he would repeal it while she will \u201cfix it.\u201d Clinton says people can\u2019t be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions and there are no lifetime limits under Obamacare. She says people under 24 can be on their parents\u2019s plans under Obamacare. She says, though, small businesses need additional help. Clinton says if we repeal Obamacare, \u201call of those benefits are lost to everybody\u2026\u201d [Classic. Put in a government program and make it impossible to repeal once folks need the benefits.]9:28: \u201cOkay, Donald,\u201d Clinton says. She says Trump wants to do anything to avoid talking about his \u201cexploding campaign\u201d and GOP establishment Republicans deserting him. Trump says the debate once again is a one-on-three battle.9:27: Trump says Clinton is again \u201clying\u201d about her deleted 33,000 emails after getting a subpoena. \u201cI am so disappointed in Congressman, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen,\u201d Trump says. He blasts Bill Clinton for talking to Attorney General Loretta Lynch nearly a month before the matter was decided.9:25: Clinton says he email scandal was a \u201cmistake\u201d and she\u2019s not \u201cmaking any excuses about it.\u201dcrowd in hall laughed when @HillaryClinton tried to say it was true that she deleted 30,000 emails #debate #debate2016\u2014 Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) October 10, 2016[Trump has an opportunity to say this election is about his words vs. a candidate who endangered the country\u2019s national security with her private email server. Will he?]9:24: \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail,\u201d Trump says after Clinton says she\u2019s glad someone with Trump\u2019s temperament who is in charge of enforcing the country\u2019s laws.9:23: Trump says people\u2019s lives have been destroyed for doing a fifth of what Clinton has done and she should be ashamed of her actions. Clinton now says \u201ceverything\u201d Trump says was absolutely false re: her private emails.9:19: Clinton claims what \u201cso much of what Trump said is not right.\u201d A very legalese answer. She says \u201cso much\u201d but not \u201call\u201d or \u201ceverything\u201d as she tries to evade the question. She quotes Michelle Obama about going high when they go low. Clinton\u00a0says everyone can draw their conclusions about the man in the video or the man on stage respects women. Clinton now brings up the Kahn family to evade the question. Funny, the moderators aren\u2019t interrupting her like they did with Trump. Clinton brings up Judge Curiel. She accuses Trump of mocking a disabled reporter. She brings up Trump\u2019s \u201cracist lie\u201d that Obama was not born in the United States. Clinton says Trump has never apologized and owes Obama an apology. Trump says she owes Obama an apology because the Clinton campaign and her allies started the birther controversy. Trump now brings up some vicious commercials Michelle Obama cut in 2008 about Hillary Clinton. He now says Obama defeated her \u201cfair and square\u201d but Clinton didn\u2019t defeat Obama fairly because the election was rigged, citing the Wikileaks email dump. Trump says if he wins, he is going to instruct the Attorney General to get a \u201cspecial prosecutor to look into your situation.\u201d\u00a09:17: Raddatz again grills Trump on the tape. Trump says he is not proud of the tape and is a person who has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for people. Trump says if you look at Bill Clinton, \u201cmine are words\u201d and \u201chis are actions.\u201d Trump says nobody in the history of politics have been as \u201cabusive to women\u201d as Bill Clinton. Trump says Hillary Clinton attacked those victims viciously. Trump now informs the world that Hilary Clinton laughed at a 12-year-old rape victim. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me about words,\u201d Trump says. \u201cBut what President Clinton did\u2026 When Hillary brings up a point like that\u2026. I think it\u2019s disgraceful and she ought to be ashamed of herself.\u201d9:12: Cooper gives Clinton a chance to respond. She says she has spent the past 48 hours thinking about the tape. Clinton says she has never questioned the fitness of other GOP candidates to serve and she says \u201cDonald Trump is different.\u201d She says Trump is \u201cnot fit to serve\u201d as president. She says Trump claimed the video doesn\u2019t represent who he is but \u201cit represents exactly who he is.\u201d Clinton says Trump has insulted women and ranked women on their appearances while also embarrassing women on television and Twitter. She blasts Trump for \u201cdenigrating a former Miss Universe\u201d in harsh and vulgar terms. Clinton says it\u2019s not only the video that raises questions about Trump\u2019s fitness. She accuses Trump now of attacking minorities as well as she desperately tries to cobble together the Obama coalition. [Once again, Clinton schooling Trump on how to pivot. Trump should have said that though he made inappropriate comments, America needs someone who puts America first instead of the special interests and globalists. He needs to frame the election in this manner.]Trump shoots back on HRC says \"it's just words, folks, it's just words\"\u2014 Lauren Blanchard (@LaurenBlanch12) October 10, 20169:10: Cooper now brings up Trump\u2019s tape. Cooper says Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women. Trump says this is \u201clocker-room talk.\u201d He says he is not proud of it and has apologized for it. Trump\u00a0says he will knock the hell out of ISIS. Cooper keeps pressing Trump on the tape. He says he has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for women while Cooper keeps pressing him on whether he has touched women without their consent. \u201cNo, I have not,\u201d Trump says before pivoting back to needing borders and making America safe and wealthy again.9:08: Trump says he entered the campaign because he got tired of seeing \u201cfoolish\u201d things being done by politicians. He brings up Obamacare, the Iran Deal (\u201cone-sided transaction\u201d with a \u201cterrorist state\u201d). Trump says America has tremendous potential and brings up the country\u2019s massive trade deficit. He says we\u2019re going to have a \u201cstrong border\u201d and \u201cbring back law and order.\u201d \u201cWe have to bring back respect to law enforcement,\u201d he says. Trump says he wants to do things that haven\u2019t been done, like fixing the inner cities to help African-Americans and Latinos/Hispanics.9:06: First questioner asks Clinton about how the last debate could have been rated \u201cMA\u201d and whether the candidates\u2019s behavior is appropriate for today\u2019s youth? (Clinton\u2019s lies re: her private email server is model behavior?) This gives Clinton a perfect opportunity to go over her talking points on a range of issues on various policy issues re: wanting to be a president for \u201call Americans.\u201d9:05: Trump and Clinton walk on stage. They seem tense and don\u2019t shake hands.\u00a09:02:Bill Clinton and Melania Trump shake hands along with the Trump family. #Debates #DebateNight pic.twitter.com/HCYM6KB5IZ\u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) October 10, 20168:58: Dana Bash in CNN points out that Bill Clinton does not have a good poker face, and he looks very, very uncomfortable tonight at the debate, especially since women who have accused him of sexual assault are in the audience with him.Bill Clinton accusers were just seated in the debate hall right in front of @SenatorDurbin : pic.twitter.com/yQSSVuKyEu\u2014 Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) October 10, 20168:57: Moderators Cooper and Raddatz now being introduced as the debate is about to begin.8:55: Coulter making great points:You have to ask yourself:  Why are the media & politicians so desperate to stop Donald Trump?

My full statement: pic.twitter.com/biRvY8S3aZ\u2014 Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) October 8, 20167:00: Though the mainstream media and both establishments in the permanent political class have piled on on Trump in earnest this week, Clinton has still not put the race away. Why? The bottom line is Hillary Clinton is still a deeply flawed candidate who cannot connect well with voters. In addition, her support of open borders and globalist-first policies have prevented many undecided voters, especially working-class voters, from going to her side. And that\u2019s why, despite all of Trump\u2019s flaws, many of which have been self-inflicted, he still seems like the football team that is only one possession away in the second half from tying up the game despite having committed turnover after turnover throughout the game.", "date": "9 Oct 2016, 4:06 PM PDT", "title": "***Live Updates*** Trump vs. Hillary, Round Two", "tags": ["2016 Presidential Race", "Big Hollywood"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/09/trumphillarytownhalldebate/"}, {"id": "post-5224267", "author": "Daniel Nussbaum", "content": "The Girl on the Train, adapted from Paula Hawkins\u2019 best-selling novel, opened to an estimated $24.7 million from 3,144 locations, according to Box Office Mojo, good enough for a first-place finish.The Emily Blunt-starring thriller \u2014 which reportedly cost less than $50 million to make \u2014 performed well among female moviegoers, who made up 68 percent of the audience, even as the film earned lukewarm reviews from critics.Meanwhile, the Nat Turner slave rebellion pic The Birth of a Nation picked up an estimated $7.1 million from 2,105 theaters this weekend, an underwhelming result for Fox Searchlight, which acquired the movie for a record $17.5 million at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year.Birth of a Nation has been mired\u00a0in controversy for months\u00a0as a 1999 rape charge against the film\u2019s writer, director and star, Nate Parker, resurfaced in media interviews this summer. Parker and his college roommate and Birth co-writer Jean Celestin were accused of rape while at Penn State in 1999; Parker was ultimately acquitted of the charges, while Celestin was convicted but had his conviction overturned on appeal.The controversy caused a massive headache for the studio, which had hoped the film would be a favorite at this year\u2019s Academy Awards.

Pollak", "content": "Today, Obama\u2019s first Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, sees Russian conspiracies everywhere, all leading to Donald J. Trump.Welcome back to the McCarthy era.It is now an article of faith in the Democratic Party that: 1) Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Donald Trump to win the U.S. election; 2) Email hacks of\u00a0the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Clinton campaign chair John Podesta help Donald Trump; 3)\u00a0Russia can be held responsible for the hacking \u2014 rightly or wrongly; 4) Trump called upon Russia to hack Clinton\u2019s email (actually, he just joked about it); 5) Trump is responsible for Wikileaks,\u00a0and perhaps\u00a0guilty of treason as well.The Russian conspiracy theory, for Democrats, obscures whatever the leaked emails contain \u2014 be they Hillary Clinton\u2019s closely-guarded Wall Street speeches, which Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) sought and failed to uncover; or be they a question passed by CNN contributor (now DNC chair) Donna Brazile to the Clinton campaign to give her an advantage in a town hall debate with Sanders in March.Brazile\u2019s version of the conspiracy theory was evasive yet concise:\u00a0\u201cOur intelligence community has made it clear that the Russian government is responsible for the cyberattacks aimed at interfering with our election, and that WikiLeaks is part of that effort. This revelation should deeply trouble all Americans in both parties. And yet, Donald Trump continues to deny that Russia is behind these attempts to meddle with our electoral process and cheer on these efforts to undermine our democracy.\u201dThe\u00a0excuse\u00a0is always the same: You cannot trust the emails, because of Russia, and Trump.It is entirely plausible that Russia is, in fact, hacking the Democrats \u2014 perhaps for fun, and perhaps for profit. Though it is a mystery why Putin would prefer Trump to Clinton, because Russia used Clinton to achieve everything it wanted in foreign affairs.Thanks to Clinton\u2019s Russian \u201creset,\u201d Russia reversed American plans for missile defense in Europe; set the stage for the invasion and annexation of the Crimea; and expanded nuclear cooperation with Iran, which still wants\u00a0nuclear weapons.Lately, Russia has begun to replace the U.S. as the pre-eminent outside power in the Middle East. That is largely the fault of Clinton\u2019s successor, the hapless John Kerry, who bumbled his way into a phony chemical weapons agreement that effectively accepted the Assad dictatorship\u00a0as a permanent fixture.But Hillary Clinton did nothing on Syria \u2014 despite self-serving claims in her memoir,\u00a0Hard Choices. The \u201chard choice\u201d would have been to resign rather than accept genocide, and she declined it.The\u00a0Washington Post tried to make excuses for Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201creset\u201d policy, as it gave her its endorsement. \u201cWhen Ms. Clinton launched the policy, Dmitry Medvedev, not Vladimir Putin, was president of Russia, and nobody \u2014 maybe not even Mr. Putin \u2014 knew how things would play out.\u201d Rubbish \u2014 everyone knew. As Clinton\u2019s own running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) said in the vice presidential debate, you would have to be ignorant of Russian history to trust Vladimir Putin \u2014 at all.The\u00a0Post also claimed: \u201cAs Mr. Putin reasserted himself and Russia became more hostile, Ms. Clinton was clear-eyed about the need to adjust U.S. policy.\u201d Really? Did she speak up in 2012 when President Obama leaned across to Medvedev over a hot mic and said those infamous words, meant to be conveyed to Putin: \u201cThis is my last election. After my election, I have more flexibility.\u201d That was near the end of Clinton\u2019s term, when she was supposedly wiser. Yet she said nothing in protest.Of interest: the fact that the Obama administration chose to blame Russia, publicly, for the hacking. That accusation was very convenient for the Clinton campaign, which now cites it at every opportunity. But the accusation makes no sense, if national interest is considered. If the accusation is false, then the White House has alienated Russia for no reason. And if it is true, the administration has just advertised the weakness of our cyber-defenses. Politics, as always for Obama and Clinton, came first.The Clinton campaign likes to argue\u00a0that Trump is friendly to Russia because of his own\u00a0business interests. But as Clinton Cash revealed, and as Wikileaks has now confirmed, the Clintons and their entourage \u2014 including Podesta \u2014 courted Russian business and patronage. Clinton allowed the State Department to approve\u00a0the infamous Uranium One deal, which placed 20% of U.S. uranium resources in the hands of a Russian firm controlled by Putin \u2014 greased by a Clinton Foundation donation.It is horrific to watch Russia march across land frontiers in Europe as if international law\u00a0simply did not exist, and to watc assist the Assad regime\u2019s mass murder. And yet the grim reality, which only Trump seems to grasp, is that Russia is also a strategic partner against Islamic terror (which Clinton refuses even to\u00a0call by its proper name). Russia\u2019s other interest is in creating chaos in the\u00a0international system. So we are, at best, \u201cfrenemies\u201d \u2014 but not friends one election, enemies the next.Democrats like to accuse Trump of xenophobia, but their Russian hysteria is actually worse, echoing their absurd pretense\u00a0in the 2010 midterms that foreign donors were using the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to influence our elections\u00a0\u2014 even as\u00a0real-life foreign donors were lining up at the Clinton Foundation to bribe their way into Hillary\u2019s good graces and largesse.The Clinton campaign\u2019s Russia conspiracy theory is little\u00a0more than\u00a0the Clintons\u2019 latest, last, desperate attempt to hide the truth.Joel B.

The Nigerian newspaper\u00a0Vanguard has published photos of some of the girls safely under the auspices of Nigerian authorities, but the photos do not have any names attached. The families in Chibok have told the newspaper they do not know yet if their daughters are part of the release.\u201cThe release of the girls\u2026 is the outcome of negotiations between the (Nigerian) administration and the Boko Haram brokered by the International Red Cross and the Swiss government. The negotiations will continue,\u201d a spokesman for President Muhammadu Buhari tweeted.\u201cThe President welcomes the release of the girls but cautioned Nigerians to be mindful of the fact that more than 30,000 fellow citizens were killed via terrorism,\u201d he added, noted that the girls will be \u201cresting\u201d before their custody will transfer to the nation\u2019s vice president.Boko Haram abducted over 200 girls from the town of Chibok, in northeastern Borno state,\u00a0in April 2014, as the girls were taking a physics final exam. Dozens escaped in the days following the attack, but after the stream\u00a0of escapees stopped flowing back to the town, the girls were rarely heard from.Boko Haram terrorist leader\u00a0Abubakar Shekau has said in various video statements that the girls were married off to jihadists, forced to convert to Islam (most are\u00a0Christian), and have since had children and been brainwashed into embracing jihadist murder. Some, he has said, were sold as slaves.In the past year, Boko Haram released two videos showing Chibok schoolgirls \u2014 one dead and one alive. In the first video, a group of the girls, whom parents were able to positively identify as the girls abducted from Chibok, asked for the government to negotiate with Boko Haram. In the second, terrorists pointed at corpses of women they claimed were the Chibok schoolgirls, allegedly killed by Nigerian government airstrikes.Boko Haram has abducted hundreds of women and children across northeastern Nigeria and continue to operate as a wing of the Islamic State \u2014 the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP). They are the deadliest terrorist group in the world.As Boko Haram often razes villages to the ground and targets markets with suicide bombings, those who escape abduction are also mired in poverty and starvation. The most conservative estimates of the number of civilians in Nigeria who have died of starvation after being cut off from food supplies by Boko Haram activity are in the hundreds.Over three million people are currently refugees in their own country, however, displaced by Boko Haram and forced out of their villages into refugee camps. Others are refugees in neighboring Chad and Cameroon, though those nations have returned many of these individuals to Nigeria. The situation in these camps is dire.\u201cAbout a million and a half of the victims have fled the Islamist extremists and are living in makeshift camps, bombed-out buildings and host communities, receiving minimal supplies from international organizations. An\u00a0additional\u00a02 million people, according to the United Nations, are still inaccessible because of the Boko Haram fighters, who control their villages or patrol the surrounding areas,\u201d\u00a0The Washington Post reported this week.The food and water shortages have forced many women who have escaped Boko Haram but ended up in refugee camps to prostitute themselves in order to eat.\u201cAt times, the food is not enough so the women resort to giving themselves for food and money,\u201d Hassana Pindar of the medical charity International Medical Corps (IMC), which runs support centers for women in the camps, said earlier this month. A recent survey by NOI polls found that 90 percent of Nigerians in refugee camps cannot find enough food to eat a healthy amount on a daily basis.When Boko Haram abducted the Chibok girls in April 2014, the U.S. government vowed aid, and\u00a0First Lady Michelle Obama sent\u00a0out a tweet.

According to Military.com, the Pentagon would not confirm how many missiles were launched in total, but three radar sites were destroyed. Previous reports suggested land-based radar might have been \u201cpainting\u201d the Mason for anti-ship missile crews.\u201cThis is a direct response to situations that threaten freedom of navigation. These strikes show our resolve against unprovoked hostility against the U.S. and are aimed at defending U.S. Navy assets,\u201d said Lt. Ian McConaughey, spokesman for U.S. Naval Forces Central Command.\u201cThese limited self-defense strikes were conducted to protect our personnel, our ships and our freedom of navigation in this important maritime passageway. The United States will respond to any further threat to our ships and commercial traffic, as appropriate, and will continue to maintain our freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, the Bab-el-Mandeb, and elsewhere around the world,\u201d said Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook.Cook said the cruise missile strikes were \u201crecommended by Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford and authorized by President Barack Obama, Cook said in the statement.\u201dThe New York Times notes this is the first time the United States has \u201cbecome involved militarily in the civil war between the Houthis, an indigenous Shiite group with loose connections to Iran, and the Yemeni government, which is backed by Saudi Arabia and other Sunni nations.\u201dThe Times wrote:Until Thursday, the Obama administration had tried to navigate a treacherous course in Yemen, publicly pushing for a peace deal while quietly providing military support to a Saudi Arabia-led bombing campaign against the rebels since last year. Yet the main goal of the administration has often appeared to be keeping the United States from being dragged too deeply into a conflict that has shown little signs of abating, and instead continues to grow deadlier.Although the radar sites targeted by Nitze\u2019s cruise missiles are described as Houthi-operated, and there seems to be increasing confidence that the Houthis conducted those missile attacks against the Mason, it has not been definitively established that Iran supplied the missiles. The NYT states that \u201cAmerican intelligence officials believe that the Houthis receive significantly less support from Iran than the Saudis and other Persian Gulf nations have charged.\u201dIran responded by sending two warships into the Gulf of Aden, the Alvand and Bushehr. Reuters relays a report from Iran\u2019s state-run Tasnim media that the ships have been sent to \u201cprotect trade vessels from piracy.\u201d\u201cTasnim said the Iranian ships will patrol the Gulf of Aden, south of Yemen, which is one of the world\u2019s most important shipping routes,\u201d Reuters added.It is not yet clear if Iran is planning a confrontation with the U.S. Navy, but if so, there would be a dash of irony to the situation, because The New York Times explains that Obama disregarded skepticism in Washington about the Saudi war in Yemen and supported them \u201cin part because it needed support in Riyadh for the nuclear deal it was then negotiating with Iran, a bitter enemy of Saudi Arabia.\u201dAnother nasty footnote: some congressional leaders suspect part of President Obama\u2019s cash payments to Iran has been used to arm the Houthis, and have asked the Pentagon to provide a detailed analysis of Iranian military funding.\u201cJust this weekend, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels shot missiles at a U.S. Navy destroyer in the Red Sea. It is not a coincidence that Iranian aggression against America and our allies has doubled since the JCPOA went into effect \u2013 the $150 billion signing bonus is clearly going a long way,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) told the Washington Free Beacon.\u201cThis makes it all the more disturbing that the Obama administration saw no reason to consult respected senior Pentagon officials like the secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before sending the mullahs yet another installment in the form of the $1.7 billion cash ransom last January. Congress has an obligation to ensure President Obama\u2019s willful blindness towards the very real threats we face does not further endanger the American people,\u201d Cruz added.", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 7:39 PM PDT", "title": "Iran Sends Warships to Yemen U.S. Navy Fires Cruise Missiles", "tags": ["Middle East", "National Security", "cruise missile", "Houthis", "Iran", "Iran Nuclear Deal", "Saudi Arabia", "U.S. Navy", "Yemen"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/13/u-s-navy-fires-cruise-missiles-yemen-iranian-warships-dispatched/"}, {"id": "post-5264852", "author": "John Hayward", "content": "The UK\u00a0Daily Mail\u00a0relates the report published at Russia\u2019s Znak.com, which said, \u201cadministration staff, regional administrators, lawmakers of all levels and employees of public corporations have been ordered to take their children out of foreign schools immediately.\u201dFailure to comply with the order would supposedly damage the official\u2019s chance to receive a promotion.Although no reason for the order was given, Russian political analysts portrayed it as a measure to \u201cprepare elites for some big war.\u201dThe\u00a0Daily Mail\u00a0notes the order was sent after \u201cPutin cancelled a planned visit to France amid a furious row over Moscow\u2019s role in the Syrian conflict and just days after it emerged the Kremlin had moved nuclear-capable missiles nearer to the Polish border.\u201dFurther reporting comes from the\u00a0Daily Star, which decided to mention World War III and illustrate the article with a picture of Putin glowering while a nuclear bomb goes off in the background:Russian politicians and officials with children studying in the West have been told to bring them home to the \u201cFatherland\u201d, local media is reporting.They have also been told to recall any older relatives \u2013 such as parents \u2013 living in foreign countries, sources claim.The worrying development \u2013 which comes after Putin suddenly cancelled a visit to France \u2013 applies to ALL state employees.Workers were reportedly told to pull their children out of school immediately, even if it was in the middle of term.The\u00a0New York Post\u00a0caught retired Russian Lt.

Prevalla has told law enforcement officials that Freitekh began to argue with him over control of the plane, and before he could wrest the plane from his hands, it had crashed. According to The\u00a0New York Times:Mr. Freitekh was coming in for a landing when he told the instructor that \u201csomething\u2019s a little off here,\u201d a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation said.

Instead, it appears the government has done nothing to contain the perverse behavior of a prisoner known as \u201cThe People-Eater,\u201d who is believed to have killed and eaten 40 people before being arrested.\u201cMore than 40 prisoners attacked him,\u201d\u00a0Carlos Herrera, father of prisoner Juan Carlos Herrera, told reporters this week. \u201cThey stabbed him and hung him to bleed him out. Mr. Dorancel, known as \u2018The People-Eater,\u2019 was the one who butchered him to feed him to all the prisoners in the T\u00e1chira prison.\u201d Dorancel Vargas is currently serving a prison sentence for cannibalism.\u201cWhoever did not do it [eat the flesh]\u2026 would be beaten, their fingers would be cut off, their legs broken, lungs perforated, they would have their heads smashed in with hammers,\u201d Herrera continued. \u201cIt was atrocious and disastrous what those people lived in there.\u201dHerrera cited another prisoner who had been released as a witness, who was with his son when he was killed and butchered.\u00a0His son, Herrera added, was kept in close quarters with a dangerous prisoner like Vargas because his family could not pay the bribe the socialist government demanded. Multiple law enforcement officers demanded 100,000 bolivares ($10,500) to transfer\u00a0his son to a less dangerous prison. The average monthly salary\u00a0in Venezuela is $20.The parent of another prisoner killed in government custody,\u00a0Luz Marina Sep\u00falveda, told a similar story. She says her son,\u00a0Anthony Correa, was \u201ctortured, murdered, and butchered, with prisoners forcing other prisoners to eat his remains.\u201dVargas, the prisoner believed to have prompted the cannibalism, has been in prison in T\u00e1chira since 1999. \u201cHis speciality was to make empanadas with the remains of his victims, which he filled with muscle parts,\u201d a Venezuelan news outlet explains. There is no indication that Venezuelan authorities have moved to prevent him from attacking other prisoners in T\u00e1chira.The socialist Venezuelan government is notorious for having little control over its common prisoner population (as opposed to the political prisoners in Ramo Verde prison, who are kept in strict isolation). In a particularly embarrassing incident for the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in January, inmates in a prison on Margarita Island \u201chonored\u201d the death of a known leader in the gang community by filming a video, using a clandestine mobile phone, of a group of prisoners shooting weapons into the air on the prison\u2019s rooftop. The prisoners carried dozens of heavy weapons to the prison\u2019s roof and appeared little concerned that authorities would know they possessed such firearms.Later in the year, Maduro made Margarita Island home of the year\u2019s Non-Aligned Nations Summit, one of the most sparsely attended such meetings in the history of that group.Caracas remains the world\u2019s most violent city, according to an annual study released in January.\u00a0", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 3:30 PM PDT", "title": "Venezuela: Government Allows Cannibal Prisoner to Torture, Eat Fellow Inmates", "tags": ["National Security", "Cannibalism", "Latin America", "socialism", "Venezuela"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/13/cannibalism-in-venezuela/"}, {"id": "post-5262837", "author": "Frances Martel", "content": "Reuters highlights the program,\u00a0which provides aid to families who cannot afford a proper burial for their relatives while providing reliable income for drug addicts. Some in the program also say that working so closely to death is a reminder of why they surrendered to police and hope to end their addiction to drugs.\u201cI knew that if I don\u2019t change, I will be in one of those caskets,\u201d a 44-year-old man who works in the program told Reuters.Reuters reports that the program pays $103 a month and is part of a larger program to help those who wish to end their drug addiction do so. In\u00a0Olongapo, one of the pilot cities for the program, 400 drug addicts have begun to work.That number is tiny compared to that of the total number of Philippine nationals who have admitted to drug abuse and surrendered to police: an estimated 700,000. Duterte has made the eradication of drug addiction and drug trafficking the cornerstone of his administration\u2019s policy, and given those involved with drugs a clear choice: surrender to police or die. Duterte has repeatedly told police to shoot first, ask questions later in drug-related operations, and encouraged bounty hunting by civilians in drug cases.CNN notes that the first phase of Duterte\u2019s anti-drug operation appears to be yielding in recent days to a greater focus on rehabilitation, now that the government has hundreds of thousands of drug addicts to reintegrate into society.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re shifting very quickly from the national security mode into the public health mode especially regarding drugs,\u201d Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella explained this week.\u00a0\u201cI think in about a month or two, the new rehab centers should be operational already.\u201dEstablishing newer, larger rehabilitation centers has become such a priority for the Duterte administration that the president has incorporated it into his foreign policy. After decades of tense relations with China, Duterte has been willing to set aside key territorial disputes to convince China to fund his anti-drug operation. It appears to have begun to pay off: Manila announced this week that a new China-funded rehabilitation facility will open in November, capable of treating up to 10,000 drug addicts.\u201cThis initiative will not only benefit these drug victims whom we want to help and reach out to, but also for the change that we envision for our country,\u201d Health Secretary Paulyn Jean Rosell-Ubial\u00a0said of the new facility.In return, Duterte has agreed to table a pivotal dispute in the South China Sea, where Beijing has colonized significant portions of the Philippines\u2019 Spratly and Paracel Islands and the Scarborough Shoal. Duterte has also made increasingly belligerent statements about the established relations between Manila and Washington, calling President Barack Obama a \u201cson of a whore\u201d and saying he was ready to \u201ccross the Rubicon\u201d with the United States.", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 12:18 PM PDT", "title": "Addicts Build Coffins in Philippines' Drug Rehab Program", "tags": ["National Security", "drug addiction", "Philippines", "Rodrigo Duterte"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/13/philippines-duterte-orders-drug-addicts-rehab-build-coffins/"}, {"id": "post-5261167", "author": "John Hayward", "content": "Former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton discussed the latest WikiLeaks revelations of favors done for \u201cFOBs\u201d (Friends of Bill Clinton) in Haiti on Thursday\u2019s edition of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM.\u201cJust to start with, Haiti, it is a series of violations of AIDs, typical procurement practices,\u201d Bolton pointed out. \u201cNot that I would hold them up as the best in the world, but there are rules about competitive bidding, and rules against the directed award of contracts.\u201d (AID is the United States Agency for International Development, also commonly referred to as USAID.)\u201cI can speak as an alumnus of AID, having been general counsel, the chief lawyer in the agency in the Reagan Administration, and also later being in charge of policy and budget. Things have changed, obviously, since then, but the main lines of competitive bidding have never changed,\u201d he said. \u201cI just this morning, in fact, in the wake of all these emails, heard from a friend who was a former senior official at AID, that he was told by a career AID person that they had been told specifically by Cheryl Mills that they should direct contracts to some company that she had never heard of. And I think that\u2019s the sort of favors being indicated in all these emails,\u201d Bolton added.\u201cIt\u2019s just extraordinary that this kind of corruption \u2013 and that\u2019s what it is. That\u2019s what competitive bidding is designed to protect against, to get the best value for our tax dollars obviously, but to prevent this kind of political favor,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd when the mainstream media finally talk about it, they don\u2019t know we\u2019ve moved toward objective reporting in America. I don\u2019t see much sign of it, I must say.\u201dBreitbart\u2019s Washington Political Editor and SiriusXM host\u00a0Matthew Boyle observed that the mainstream media and political class are \u201creally stopping at nothing to try to keep Donald Trump from winning.\u201dBolton responded:Well, I think within the mainstream media, the Wall Street Journal editorial page some weeks back pointed out very well, they called the media \u2013 and really it\u2019s true both with respect to the Obama Administration and the Clinton campaign \u2013 they called the mainstream media their stenographers.\u00a0Whatever they put out, they write. They\u2019ve just abandoned all pretense of objectivity, and so it really comes down to whether the American voter can withstand this barrage of misinformation, and still make a clear choice about who they want for President and Senate and House, in all the various elections we\u2019re going to see in less than a month now.Bolton thought it was a little too early to draw comparisons between the 2016 presidential race and the Brexit vote, but added:I think what was uncovered there has been something that\u2019s happened in various American elections over the years as well. When people know what the politically correct answer is to a pollster \u2013 whether they\u2019re doing it over the phone, whether they\u2019re doing it automatically on a touch-tone phone, or whether it\u2019s a real person interviewing them \u2013 they understand that their answers are gonna be seen by other people, and so they will tend, for their own protection, to give the politically correct answer, whether it\u2019s what they really believe or not.\u201cSo in the case of Brexit, there were undoubtedly people who didn\u2019t want to say that they were going to\u00a0vote to leave, so they either said Remain or undecided,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt turned out to be a substantial number of people, and they prevailed on the referendum day, June 23. Now, whether that\u2019s the case here, we don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt people know what the politically correct answer is.\u201dBolton said another WikiLeaks document revealing Hillary Clinton\u2019s support for \u201copen borders\u201d was \u201cnot that different really, in fact it\u2019s the same phrase that John Kerry used just a few months ago, to say that the world had to get ready for open borders.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very interesting, for example, to see if the new U.N. Secretary-General, who has held essentially that same position, pushes for that when he takes office on January the 1st,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cAnd it ties into another statement in one of Podesta\u2019s emails that was leaked, that it\u2019s increasingly necessary for candidates, at least on his side, to have one public position and one private position. So, you know, if you like organized hypocrisy, if you like flat-out deceit, then that\u2019s the campaign that\u2019s taking it to new heights. Seems to me if this is something that matters still to the American people, they ought to reflect that in how they vote on Election Day,\u201d he concluded.Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.LISTEN:", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 9:16 AM PDT", "title": "Bolton on WikiLeaks Revelations: Hillary Clinton Thinks the World Must 'Get Ready for Open Borders\u2019", "tags": ["2016 Presidential Race", "National Security", "Radio", "2016 election", "Brexit", "Clinton Foundation", "Haiti", "Hillary Clinton", "John Bolton", "John Kerry", "Mass Migration", "Media Bias", "Open Borders"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/10/13/bolton-on-wikileaks-revelations-hillary-clinton-thinks-the-world-must-get-ready-for-open-borders/"}, {"id": "post-5256637", "author": "John J. Xenakis", "content": "This morning\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\nBurning barricades in Bujumbura, Burundi\u2019s capital city, last year (UN)A United Nations reports on Burundi has documented human rights violations on a wide, systemic, massive scale by the government of president Pierre Nkurunziza.The hundreds of documented violations include torture, sexual violence, arbitrary jailings, targeted assassinations and summary executions. The targets of this massive violence were mostly political opponents who opposed Nkurunziza\u2019s third term as president, in apparent violation of the constitution, which limits presidents to two terms. Nkurunziza claimed that his first term doesn\u2019t count because he was appointed by the parliament, rather than being directly elected.Nkurunziza\u2019s decision to run for a third term in April of last year triggered street protests by young people. Nkurunziza\u2019s security forces confronted the peaceful protests with bullets, tear gas and water cannon, killing about ten people in four days of violence.Burundi\u2019s last generational crisis war was the 1994 Rwanda genocide, which also involved Burundi, in which ethnic Hutus killed some 800,000 ethnic Tutsis in three months. Burundi is now in a generational Awakening era, and is following the pattern where the first generation to grow up after the war are now staging protests. Nkurunziza is an ethnic Hutu, and his massive torture and violence is targeting Tutsis.During America\u2019s last generational Awakening era, in the 1960s when the first post-World War II generation came of age, there were student protests, but the government did not resort to torture, sexual violence, arbitrary jailings, targeted assassinations and summary executions to counter them. So, there is a wide spectrum of behaviors that a government can exhibit during the Awakening era that follows the end of a generational crisis war by about 15-20 years.Syria is also in a generational Awakening era, and Syria\u2019s president Bashar al-Assad is on the most violent end of the spectrum. The Syrian civil war pitted Shia/Alawites against Sunni Muslims, and climaxed in 1982. Today, the Shia/Alawite al-Assad is targeting millions innocent Sunni women and children with barrel bombs, chemical weapons (chlorine gas), phosphorous bombs, cluster bombs and bunker bombs.We\u2019ve described a similar pattern, including Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka. The pattern is this: There is a bloody generational crisis civil war between two ethnic groups. The civil war is so horrific that the survivors vow that it will never happen again. The first generation growing up after the civil war, and with no personal memory of its horrors, begins peacefully protesting. The country leader, often from ethnic group that \u201cwon\u201d the civil war, stays in power and resists peaceful protesters with violence, using the excuse that he wants to prevent another ethnic civil war.Since the initial violence in Burundi began in April of last year, the violence has continued to worse. More than 500 people have died from extrajudicial killings, and at least 270,000 people have fled the country to Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and DRC. United Nations Human Rights and IRIN (United Nations) and All AfricaRelated ArticlesThe recent United Nations report accusing the Burundi regime of Pierre Nkurunziza of massive human rights violations has infuriated regime officials, and caused them to take several steps to isolate themselves and protect themselves from retribution for the human rights violations.For a while last year, the African Union was discussing the possibility of sending in peacekeeping troops to protect civilians from violence, but that had to be abandoned when Nkurunziza said that the AU peacekeepers would be treated as an invading army. (Some analysts responded to this failure by calling it the \u201cAfrican disunion.\u201d Similarly, the UN failure to stop the genocide is Syria is sometimes called the \u201cDisunited Nations.\u201d)Last week, Nkurunziza barred three United Nations human rights experts from entering the country and declared them persona non grata. The three had been associated with the United Nations report.Now on Wednesday, Burundi\u2019s legislature has voted to leave the International Criminal Court (ICC). One Burundi lawmaker said that \u201cThe ICC is a tool being used to try and change power,\u201d making the same sort of excuse that Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad uses when criticized for his war crimes. Burundi officials have expressed fear that they will be charged with crimes against humanity. They would be the first country ever to withdraw from the ICC.The withdrawal from the ICC will take effect one year after the government formally notifies the United Nation of its intention. In the meantime, some politicians are asking the ICC to speed up the ongoing preliminary examination and bring charges within a year.The violence in Burundi has not yet reached the full-scale genocidal slaughter that we\u2019re seeing from the al-Assad regime in Syria, but it\u2019s pretty clear that the Nkurunziza regime in Burundi is headed in the same direction.

I wish we could have a project on building a progressive Islam. Would require advocating for and lifting up progressive leaders in that nation to speak about it/ to do online campaigning around it/etc. We tend to be overly focused on the violent strains of the radicalism. But even if there weren\u2019t violence, the fact that too many who are for subjugation of women, against gays, against Jews and Christians, etc \u2013 is a serious problem for our future. Unfortunately, if you sounded progressive in the Middle East/Pakistan, you\u2019d be putting yourself at security risk.Shakir\u2019s email was on of thousands linked to Podesta that have been recently released by Wikileaks. Sen. Reid\u2019s adviser\u2019s comments were in response to Podesta asking him what he thought about Clinton\u2019s Nov. 19, 2015 speech on national security and the Islamic State \u00a0(ISIS/ISIL).Shakir\u2019s reference to Saudi Arabia appears to be related to Clinton urging the Sunni powerhouse during her speech \u201cto stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations, as well as the schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path to radicalization.\u201dSurprisingly, progressive Muslims do not appear to have too much faith in liberal politicians.Liberal Muslim Feminist born in India Asra Nomani told the progressive journal Democracy:I implore liberals in the West to join liberal Muslims in challenging the interpretations of Islam that belie progressive values, from punishment for consensual zina [sex out of marriage] to forcing women into the basements of mosques. In the Muslim Reform Movement, we stand for human rights. My hope is liberals will stand with us for humanity.Other progressive Muslims argue that, despite America\u2019s war on terror, the United States maintains a close relationship with many authoritarian states that empower those who are posing the most serious challenges to modernizing Islam.Unlike their conservative counterparts, the progressive adherents of Islam support equal rights for women, gays, Jews, and Christians, as mentioned by Reid\u2019s advisor Shakir.Also surprisingly, some liberal Muslims reportedly say it is the politically progressive people they have come across who appear to favor maintaining the status-quo \u2014 conservative Muslims\u00a0who fit the typical image of a Muslim and sound like one.During the speech, the now Democratic Presidential nominee showed no qualms about calling the jihadi threat facing the United States and other parts of the world \u201cradical jihadism,\u201d a phrase that President Barack Obama and some members of his administration have been hesitant to use. Obama has refused to even say \u201cradical Islam.\u201dShakir praised Clinton for doing that, saying:I think the \u2018radical jihadism\u2019 language works well. As you know, I wouldn\u2019t have picked the fight over \u2018radical islam\u2019 to begin with. I\u2019m always happy to just concede that it\u2019s a real thing and define it as a marginalized strain, which she did do today [November 2015]\u2026From a policy perspective, there\u2019s a radical strain. Moreover, I like making the Muslim world feel like they need to activate to separate themselves and define themselves (which is happening).The Democracy journal article features four liberal Muslim Americans sharing their thoughts about what they considered to be the progressive roots of Islam.Among the liberal view points of Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), Muslim Feminist Nomani, Ani Zonneveld, founder and president of Muslims for Progressive Values, which reinterprets the texts of the Quran, and Hassan Abbas, who was born to a Sunni and a Shiite parents in Pakistan.Nomani noted that the primary struggle progressive Muslims are facing is \u201cto challenge interpretations of Islam that promote political Islam, sexism, and intolerance. I ask liberals to stand up with liberal Muslims for the values dear to their hearts, rather than being silent for fear of offending a minority group.\u201dSome progressive Muslim women refuse to wear a hijab, which despite protests against countries who force visitors and residents to do so by law, the liberal Muslim women in America feel like they are doing something wrong.\u201cAs a progressive Muslim, I don\u2019t wear a hijab, and I\u2019ve seen several times where I\u2019ve been interviewed by NPR and on public TV for example, at the end of the day my contribution to a particular story was cut out because I didn\u2019t fit the typical image of what a Muslim is, or fit the sound of what a typical Muslim is,\u201d said Zonneveld.", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 6:19 AM PDT", "title": "Wikileaks: Sen.

Now we\u2019ll\u00a0dig\u00a0into\u00a0RimWorld. Let\u2019s start with influences. Of course, Dwarf Fortress is an obvious one. Then aside from the character interaction influences from The Sims,\u00a0I would imagine maybe simulations like\u00a0Theme\u00a0Hospital\u00a0also contributed?Tynan: Well, stepping outside of \u2014 you covered the games pretty well. The biggest influence is probably Dwarf Fortress. And then there is sort of a genre of games that are similar to that, like The Sims, Prison Architect. Like you mentioned, Theme\u00a0Hospital is more of a distant cousin. There\u2019s basically a genre of games where you look down on people, and you kind of can get to know individuals to some degree. I think that would be the primary influence.But stepping outside of the games themselves, for Dwarf Fortress there\u2019s this whole subculture of people who write stories about what happened in the game. It\u2019s been around for years. So there\u2019s these giant long stories where people will pass around their saved games and each one play a year or something in the game. And then each one will write or illustrate things that happened.Nate: Like Boatmurdered.Tynan: Yeah,\u00a0Boatmurdered, Gemclawed. So, before I made RimWorld I read these stories, and I would say that that is more of the inspiration than\u00a0the game itself. I played Dwarf Fortress for like eight or ten hours, but I read these stories for many more hours than that. And I really just wanted to make a game that could create a story like this, because it\u2019s fascinating how people could take something so abstract, and so simple, and imbue it with such meaning \u2014 which is the same mechanism that people do when they read words on a page in a novel.So, that\u2019s a huge inspiration for me, but it\u2019s not an inspiration like \u201cWe\u2019re going to do it like this,\u201d but more \u201cthis is possible, this is something that works,\u201d you know? It\u2019s the same way that Pong could be an inspiration for a shooter, where you\u2019re like \u201cpeople are really compelled by shooting things with things, you know?\u201d Or like Galaga or Space Invaders or something could be an inspiration for an FPS. It\u2019s like, \u201cthis works, this is something that works.\u201d Now, that\u2019s well mined out I think.Nate: Yeah, I think as an industry, we\u2019re pretty much covered as far as \u201cshooting things at things.\u201d There\u2019s nothing wrong with it, but it\u2019s not exactly a new frontier.Tynan: The way people would see a story in a game, and the way the game does things to\u00a0make that happen \u2014 to me, that was a huge inspiration. It\u2019s really those stories that inspired RimWorld more than anything.But beyond that, in terms of the fictional backing and theme, there\u2019s these great novels by Allistair Reynolds, there\u2019s Dune from Frank Herbert, and Warhammer 40k, like the slurry of ideas that\u2019ve embedded themselves in my brain from a lifetime of absorbing these types of things, definitely. But, I mean, it could have been a different fiction.I would say, really, what\u2019s unique about the game is that it definitely came from those stories \u2014 stories of Dwarf Fortress, old Starcraft battle reports that people used to write before YouTube was around \u2014 they would report their Starcraft game with all of these emotional turns, and little stories of like this space marine who was trying to stop the zerglings and he couldn\u2019t. Creating stories from simple game mechanics I think is just something fascinating to me. Whenever I\u2019ve seen that, it\u2019s always been interesting to me, and those are the things that inspired RimWorld.Nate:\u00a0I\u2019ve noticed right up front in RimWorld that you have a lot of tools to give the players a chance to choose how they tell their story. You can choose an AI storyteller, you can generate a map and choose where in the world you want to be. With the scenario editor, you can add twists to the mixture \u2014 I tried a cannibal tribe, for instance.\u00a0It\u2019s a lot more robust than \u201ceasy, medium, or hard.\u201dTynan: Well, the thing with easy, medium, and hard is that it ultimately revolves around the idea that you\u2019re going to get your rocks off in this game by triumph, you know? [laughs]Nate: Right.Tynan: You know, so it comes back to the same thing. All those things, those old patterns, they come after the same thing \u2014 which is okay, it\u2019s a challenge, the game is about challenge and you want the challenge to be appropriate for you. That\u2019s part of RimWorld, because there is definitely a challenge, and \u201ctriumph\u201d is definitely a part of it, but the reason its set up that way is \u2014 it accomplishes a few things.There are different types of players who want to have different types of experiences. Or maybe the same person, who just wants to do something different. Some people just like building stuff in the game, so I wanted to create an AI storyteller that would support that. Some people want more of a steady, kind of classic challenge curve, so I created one for that. And some people really just want to try something random, so I created that, too.Nate: Random is by far my favorite. That\u2019s the Dwarf Fortress way to play. Lots of\u00a0\u201cFUN!\u201dTynan: It\u00a0just does random stuff like 4 raids at one time, just crazy things. I would say there\u2019s another aspect of it, which is if you let people choose these things, they will be more accepting of them when they happen. Especially random \u2014 I wanted random to be part of the game, but I don\u2019t feel like I just force that on everybody because it\u2019s unfair. It\u2019s literally unfair, and kind of ridiculous at times.Nate:\u00a0But awesome.Tynan: Yeah, like there\u2019s such value in it, because it creates these absurd extreme situations, which are\u00a0great for the drama.\u00a0It\u2019s great for the intensity. But it also, the way it does that is just by saying, you know, \u201cfuck your rules, fuck your pacing, fuck your difficulty level. I don\u2019t give a shit, we\u2019re just doing something, right? We\u2019re just doing something totally random.\u201dAnd to just give that to everyone, I think I\u2019d get a lot of complaints, because a lot of people would just get killed \u2014 they\u2019d build some colony, and fall in love with it, and then get murdered. So I want it to be something that you\u2019ll choose, and if you choose it, you\u2019ll accept it. If you know what you\u2019re getting into, you\u2019ll accept it and enjoy it. It\u2019s basically trying to make it acceptable in that sense.And the other thing is, it\u2019s just basically an easy sort of a cheap way for me to make the game appeal to a broader variety of players. You know, I\u2019m always looking for something that\u2019s easy to implement, and essentially a requirement of how I design the game was that everything has to be able to happen at any time. There can\u2019t be any restrictions. Which means that every event, every incident, has to be made in this really robust way, so that it can occur in context.So your guys can try to get married while there is a pack of man-hunting wolves at the door, or something, right? And the systems will account for this, and they will work together. And once you\u2019ve done that, it becomes very easy to just sort of throw all those events together in different configurations. And so it\u2019s just basically a cheap way of trying to push the game system in different ways. Once the game system is robust, why not make it work in different ways?That goes for the biomes too \u2014 why not play in the steamy jungle, or this frozen wasteland, or a nice forest, or this desert? The game supports all these, because it supports every range of temperature from like -100 degrees Celsius, to +100, where everyone\u2019s dying of heat stroke, or getting burned and dying. So if it\u2019s going to support that for seasons, you might as well let people play in different types of environments. Once you built the game properly, it\u2019s easy to do things that let people create an experience which is different from their last one.Finally, it\u2019s also about replayability, you know? Once you played your normal storyteller in the forest, maybe you want to try a random one in desert, or an easy one in the ice sheet to get a different type of experience, or go in the jungle and deal with tons of disease. All the systems are there, so let people create an experience that they can own. Basically, it\u2019s easy to do, so do it, and put the variation in because it\u2019s already there, so make it work.Nate: So, speaking of storytelling, because that\u2019s obviously a cornerstone of the game, of this sort of emergent experience \u2014Tynan: Story generation.Nate: Generation. Yeah, sorry. [laughs] Will we be seeing any kind of combat log or event log that will kind of help us to sort of narrate the stories, so that people can more easily share them?Tynan: Well, I mean\u00a0it\u2019s certainly\u00a0a classic idea, and I think it\u2019s a strong one. But, as a general rule, I don\u2019t discuss future features, just because I don\u2019t know \u2014 I don\u2019t have enough knowledge to predict what\u2019s going to happen. There have been lots of times in the past where I was like, okay\u2026\u00a0Just thinking to myself, \u201cnext month we\u2019re going to do XYZ,\u201d and by the time next month rolls around, like a million things have come up. You have better ideas, someone has suggested something better, and there\u2019s some tax paperwork to do, and it\u2019s not going to happen, right? So, I don\u2019t like to speculate.We\u2019re working on some really exciting stuff. Alpha \u2014 the next alpha, I think it\u2019s Alpha 16 \u2014 is going to be huge. But I can\u2019t say what that is.\u00a016 has kind of a mega feature that isn\u2019t talked about. But no, I can\u2019t say specifically about the future because I don\u2019t know. I can tell you something but then, you know, it might not happen and people would get pissed off. I\u2019ll let people be happy when we can guarantee that their happiness is coming to fruition.Nate:\u00a0Do you have any idea in your mind of\u00a0what RimWorld 1.0 looks like?Tynan: Not really. I mean, what I have is this giant design queue of every idea I\u2019ve thought of, some half-written designs. Basically just a giant Google Doc \u2014 it\u2019s like 40 pages now \u2014 of all this stuff, and I just sort it. And like the idea you mentioned, the combat log, is on there, as well as\u00a0a million other things. I\u2019m not going to do all of them, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to do all of them. I mean, this document grows faster than I can consume it, because it\u2019s easier to have ideas than to implement them. But, there are certainly some I would like to do.But no, in terms of specific target, I\u2019ve never really worked that way. It\u2019s always been \u2014 to me, it\u2019s essentially sort of a self-soothing, misleading approach to game design, when you\u2019re in my business position, to sort of imagine exactly what the final game is going to be. The reality is, as a designer, I don\u2019t know. If I\u2019m being honest with myself, I know stuff is going to come up that I don\u2019t anticipate, and I know that I\u2019m going to have to change the design around. So I just don\u2019t bother looking that far into the future. Rather, I just keep all the ideas, and when it\u2019s time to do something, I do the analysis at that time when I really know what is going on.Nate: With something as open-ended as RimWorld, I can imagine that\u2019s probably the only way you can do it without making\u00a0yourself crazy.Tynan: Yeah, it\u2019s a design approach that I came up with while I was writing the \u2014 well, I sort of developed over time, but for me it works really well. I\u2019m not sure it would work well for a big studio project, where you need to have a marketing plan like two years ahead of time, or something like that. But staying nimble like that, and letting the \u201cfuture you\u201d make the decision instead of forcing the \u201cpresent you\u201d to decide a year ahead of time, leads to much higher quality decisions, in my experience.Nate: So I\u2019ve observed that as features get added to RimWorld, it seems to be that the game gets essentially \u201cdarker.\u201d The more things that the colonists\u00a0can do, the\u00a0more ways they can horribly kill themselves.Tynan: [laughing]\u00a0Well, I guess. I mean, yeah.Nate:\u00a0Is the increase in complexity just inevitably destructive? Or is there a way to engineer these experiences with a more positive bent? I guess I\u2019m asking whether that\u2019s a deliberate design decision, or a by-product?Tynan: Yeah, I know what you mean.\u00a0I\u2019ve been reevaluating this recently. What you\u2019re describing is essentially the result of sort of my internal process, where I\u2019ve been targeting the things that seem to have the most story drama potential \u2014Nate: I love that sort of grimdark comedy it creates. I\u2019m definitely not saying it\u2019s a negative.Tynan:\u00a0Oh no, I didn\u2019t think you were. I think targeting the drama has been effective, because people are telling their stories of like,\u201d oh my god people have gotten addicted to this, and it was really difficult to get them off, but their wife helped them through it,\u201d et cetera.We did add relationships and stuff, so colonists do get married, and they also get divorced and stuff. There are definitely happy moments in there. But in terms of the negativity, I would say it\u2019s a side effect of the pursuit of drama on my part. And now I\u2019m sort of noticing \u2014 and this has been brought up a few times \u2014 a lot of the game mechanics sort of point towards these sorts of grim situations, which is a side effect of the fact that grim situations are really dramatic.Nate:\u00a0Understandable. A lot of the fun comes from harrowing situations.\u00a0That sense of peril, hovering on the edge of total catastrophe.Tynan: Yeah, it\u2019s\u00a0a lot of fun.\u00a0There\u2019s danger and risk and things are at stake, you know? It also ties into game systems, where we physically track if the people are hungry, they\u2019re tired, they\u2019re wounded. It\u2019s harder to track positive aspirational things about a character; those tend to be more, \u201cI feel self-actualized,\u201d or something. It\u2019s very difficult to simulate that.Nate: Yeah, I follow.Tynan: It\u2019s like Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy, right? It\u2019s easy to calculate things at the bottom of the hierarchy. It\u2019s very easy to write a system to simulate that. But to write a system to simulate the top of Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy is like, that\u2019s a strong AI problem. I can\u2019t do it. So, you have to sort of fudge it.In any case, yeah, so I\u2019m seeking drama, but it has ended up with these extreme situations \u2014 most of which won\u2019t happen in any given game, but yes you can have drug-addicted cannibal psychopath starving murderers, if you want. But this is something I was thinking about, and I was thinking it would be cool if I added some more positive-type emotional valances to the game, just to balance it out, to have a back and forth, sometime in an upcoming update.In terms of emotional valence, the game is really hitting the notes with \u2014\u00a0think of the most grim survival movie you can, like The Grey or whatever \u2014 it\u2019s definitely got those feelings in it, and they\u2019re really dramatic, and it\u2019s great. But, it would also be really cool if it had enough variation to have, like, \u201crom-com\u201d emotions in it too, you know? If you could go back and forth.And right now you can, to a degree, because there is a relationship system, and people will get in quirky relationships where one guy shacks up with the mother, and then they break up, and then he marries the daughter. You know, you can imagine some goofy story about this if you want. But, yeah, no. That\u2019s definitely a good point. It\u2019s been tipping into dark territory, but I hope to balance that over time.Nate: So we\u2019ve talked about different aspects you\u2019re considering, things you\u2019re progressively tackling, and the forty pages or so of potential features. Do you plan any of this more than one update in advance?Tynan: No.\u00a0[laughs] Well I have a lifetime worth of content \u2014 it\u2019s all there swirling around, right? Uh, no. Planning? The word \u201cplan\u201d implies that you\u2019re going to do it, like you really think you\u2019re going to do it; there\u2019s a very high percentage chance you\u2019re going to do it.Nate: Right, that\u2019s where I\u2019m going with this. [laughs]Tynan: Which I don\u2019t do. In fact, I\u2019ll keep that to under two weeks if I can.\u00a0We might add more features to the next alpha, or we might just release it as soon as the current workload is done. There\u2019s just no point; why plan, why try to guess at the future and then lock yourself into some specific course of action? Just decide later, because you\u2019re going to know more, right? And you\u2019re going to have a better decision if you just do it later. So, let \u201cfuture you\u201d decide, you know? Because \u201cpresent you\u201d is an idiot.It would be like if I let my life decisions be made by the 5-years-ago version of me; he was an idiot, he didn\u2019t have all of\u00a0my\u00a0experiences. So, I try to decide as close as I can \u2014 essentially decide things with as much knowledge as possible, which implies deciding things as late as possible. Which, I can do because it\u2019s an indie company with just a few people, and we have that kind of nimbleness. It\u2019s an advantage of being indie, and it\u2019s one that I do play to the hilt, every time.Nate:\u00a0How\u2019s that been working out for you so far? The Steam release, obviously, has been pretty successful. Steam Spy\u2019s latest estimate is over 320,000 on that platform alone, but you\u2019d been selling it well before that. Was there a big jump once you released to Steam?Tynan: Oh, yeah, definitely. I would say sales probably went up over tenfold, I think, when it went on Steam. Obviously it did fall down; it was crazy in the first few days, and in the first week, it\u2019s gone down quite a bit since release. But the game still is sort of clinging to in-and-out of the Top 10 sellers on Steam. I think it was in the Top Ten today and yesterday. And this is over two months after the release, and it\u2019s not even a final game; it\u2019s early access.So, I\u2019m pretty damn happy with it. I mean, what can I say? It\u2019s been doing really well, it\u2019s been doing great. So, it\u2019s a fantastic validation that somebody likes what we\u2019re doing here. And, thank you to everyone for that. What else can I say? It\u2019s been doing really well.Nate:\u00a0Does that level of validation make you want to try new projects, or are you sticking with RimWorld for the foreseeable future?Tynan: Well, again, I don\u2019t know, right?Nate: That\u2019s a question for \u201cfuture you.\u201dTynan: Yeah, seriously. It\u2019s funny. I mean, every time I do an AMA on Reddit, or I did one on Kotaku last week \u2014 Literally half the questions are, \u201cIs this going to happen? Is this going to happen?\u201d I\u2019m like \u201cI don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know the future, guys.\u201d I\u2019m much better at talking about the present and the past, because otherwise I\u2019m just guessing at it all.Nate: I think people get really jumpy because a huge percentage of early access games just sort of fade into nothingness. It makes us\u00a0cagey. We\u00a0want to know what\u2019s going to happen.Tynan: And I think it\u2019s totally pointless, too. Because you can ask for giant promises, and a developer can give you big promises. It doesn\u2019t fucking mean it\u2019s going to happen, you know?Nate:\u00a0It\u2019s true.Tynan: In fact, I would say, you should look for the developers who don\u2019t make those giant promises. Because the ones who are like, \u2018Yeah and it\u2019s going to have sharks, and it\u2019s going to have nuclear bombs!\u2019Nate:\u00a0More sharks and bombs than you can ever potentially see. Eighteen quintillion \u2014Tynan:\u00a0[laughs] I\u2019m not naming anyone,\u00a0okay?Nate: [laughs]Tynan: But the bigger the promises, the more likely they are to be disconnected from reality. So, I think an intelligent gamer who wants to find a developer they can trust, should look for someone who\u2019s making measured statements, and is not saying things that are too distant from reality. Because they really shouldn\u2019t be making those claims, because they really don\u2019t know. And that\u2019s what I try to uphold all this time.Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of new players coming into the RimWorld sphere \u2014 especially recently, with the Steam release \u2014 but it still surprises me sometimes when I get people who are like, \u201cOh, are you going to abandon the game? Are you just going to drift away?\u201d I\u2019m like, guys I\u2019ve been doing this for three years! Every single month, somebody\u2019s like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re going to abandon the game now,\u201d and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, tell us what\u2019s going to happen. Otherwise, it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re just leaving.\u201dAnd every time I release something and it goes great and there\u2019s a new update, all those criticisms are essentially silenced and proven to be wrong. But, then there\u2019s always a new generation of people who are like, \u201cOh he\u2019s going to abandon it this time.\u201d I\u2019m like guys, please just look at the record.Nate: It\u2019s a very paranoid market.Tynan: Go look at the record; I\u2019ve done exactly everything I ever said I was going to do, and more on the game. I\u2019m pretty much one for one on promises in RimWorld. So, I\u2019m saying I\u2019m going to keep developing it, and it\u2019s going to be finished in a satisfactory way. So, that\u2019s going to happen. That\u2019s all I can say. I really do value credibility, and I think it\u2019s really important to be serious about saying things that you know are actually true, or will become true.I take that very seriously, which is part of why I don\u2019t give a lot of speculation about future events, because I don\u2019t really know. Yeah, I try to build that up, and I think that the players who have been around for a while will know that. But, yeah, all I can say to anyone else is, \u201cDon\u2019t ask me about the future; I\u2019d rather you look at my past.\u201dNate:\u00a0I do agree that the past is perhaps the strongest predictor of the future.Tynan: Well, I mean, there\u2019s the old adage, right? Don\u2019t listen to what people say. Watch what they do. And that\u2019s how you really get to know who people are.\u00a0\u00a0I want to once again thank Tynan Sylvester for taking the time for such an extensive discussion, and for his candor. If you haven\u2019t already, do check out part 1 on Tynan himself, and part 2 on the state of the gaming industry as a whole.

Montz argues that the increased level of chaos on college campuses is a result of university administrators who \u201cbend to their will.\u201dMontz claims that in his time at Brown University he was able to have deep, open conversations about important and controversial topics such as race, class, and gender. Despite this being the environment at Brown 15 years ago, Montz believes that Brown administrators are suffocating stimulating conversations, and students feel afraid to be wrong about topics that have been deemed sensitive by the administrators and students who are the most concerned with social justice.Such conversations, though, depend on a shared commitment to intellectual openness \u2014 and the kind of activism infecting Brown and other campuses all over the country explicitly rejects the value of such openness. Students are on a hair-trigger, eager to turn minor slights into examples of \u201cstructural\u201d oppression and assume nefarious motives in critics. They regularly deploy an insidious rhetorical sleight-of-hand that equates the mental discomfort of hearing adverse opinions with real, physical violence. Those who question affirmative action, rape culture\u00a0or other planks of the prevailing campus orthodoxy aren\u2019t just wrong; they\u2019re making the campus \u201cunsafe.\u201dThese tactics don\u2019t spark conversation. They choke it off. And left unchecked, the activists peddling them will continue to degrade the campus climate President Paxson and other college administrators claim to value.Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.

Let\u2019s be honest, all of my speeches are great and I love not only reliving my own work, but they stand out as two of the important enemies that America is facing today.Another thought struck me: many of the things we find disgusting about feminism and Islam are actually interchangeable.Tonight I\u2019d like to revisit a few of my most hated things about both Islam and Feminism, but as I speak, I want you to think about just how similar these ideologies actually are.Feminism has formed an unholy alliance with Islam, one that must be resisted to keep not only our Universities free, but our culture too.I quite like critiquing feminists, because they\u2019re easier to outrun than Muslims if I upset them. But today we\u2019re going to be brave, and critique both at the same time.[SLIDE: Male Feminists and Male Muslims \u2014 Both Perverts]Feminism is responsible for producing the pathetic, unlovable creature known as the \u201cmale feminist.\u201dThese beta orbiting cucks proudly carry the feminist banner, because they look at joining the cause as their best hope to get laid. Why do you think so many male feminists turn out to be virgins, perverts or, more often, both?It\u2019s weird isn\u2019t it, how perverts are drawn to an ideology that claims to be respectful and protective of the female gender. It\u2019s like the infamous pedophile Jimmy Savile, who regularly donated to children\u2019s charities. As well as providing him with victims, it gave him cover.Islam, which claims to protect its women\u2019s virtue and impose rules on its men, does exactly the same thing.Muslim perversion is well-known. It\u2019s not surprising really. After all, their prophet banged a 9-year old girl! And they have other \u2026 inclinations.I could also talk about goats now, but that would be too easy. Instead, consider the plight of Europe, a continent now flooded with Muslims.There\u2019s Sweden, which now has rape numbers that actually do match feminist statistics. That happened after Muslim immigration.Then there\u2019s Germany, where thousands of women were assaulted on the streets after their genius Chancellor decided to invite millions of refugees across her country\u2019s borders. Now those same refugees are violating women\u2019s borders.And Britain, where I come from, has Muslim rape gangs molesting and raping thousands of young women and underage girls. For years, the police ignored the problem because they didn\u2019t want to be called racist.Every immigrant group seeks a better life than the old country. All except Muslims, who seek to\ncreate replicas of their hellhole countries in each new nation they colonise.Islam is the only group that tells its members not \u201cWhen in Rome, do as the Romans do,\u201d but rather, \u201cWhen in Rome, demand benefits and rape people.\u201dThe situation with regressive social attitudes from Muslims in Europe is getting so bad that Vlad The Impaler is acquiring a reputation as a folk hero.I enjoy being abused, but only if it\u2019s consensual. Muslim immigration is one of the main reasons I left Europe, and I advise women to do whatever I can to follow me. You see, Europe hasn\u2019t solved the refugee crisis \u2014 they\u2019ve just created a new one.And where are the feminists? The feminists who think a mythical, made-up \u201crape culture\u201d on college campuses is a real thing? Europe now has a real rape culture, but feminists don\u2019t want to talk about it. That\u2019s virtue-signalling for you folks. Talking about the made-up crimes of white college-age men gets you more social justice retweets than a real rape epidemic involving brown people.Almost every effort to control speech and shut down either \u201cabusive speech\u201d or \u201chate speech\u201d is a feminist project.About 1 year ago, the United Nations suggested we censor the entire Internet to save feminist\u2019s feelings.They released a completely insane report called \u201cCyber Violence Against Women And Girls: A Global Wake-up Call\u201d.Now, if I was writing a report on \u201ccyber-violence,\u201d I could do it in 140 characters, but someone infinitely more gifted already has.Hahahahahahahaha How The Fuck Is Cyber Bullying Real Hahahaha Nigga Just Walk Away From The Screen Like Nigga Close Your Eyes Haha\u2014 Tyler, The Creator (@tylerthecreator) December 31, 2012The UN report itself contains a number of bizarre attempts to equate critical tweets on the internet with physical violence.\u201cA cyber-touch is recognised as equally as harmful as a physical touch\u201d says the report. In their press release, UN Women claim that \u201ccyber violence \u2026 places a premium on emotional bandwidth.\u201dWhatever the fuck \u201cemotional bandwidth\u201d is.Anita Sarkeesian went before the UN and called for \u201claws\u201d to deal with \u201charassment,\u201d which she defined as being told to \u201cshut up\u201d on Twitter.And speaking of Twitter, look what they did when they stacked their trust and safety council with these lunatics. They basically killed Twitter by embracing the nonsense idea of \u201conline harassment.\u201d And of course, by booting their most fabulous and entertaining user. All the while letting ISIS remain active on the platform.Now to say that Islam has an issue with free speech would be like saying that feminists have an issue with calories: not only obvious but entirely true.We know the horrific state of free speech in Muslim countries. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, China jailed the most journalists in 2015. But 9 of the next 11 countries with the most jailed journalists were Muslim countries. And speaking of 9/11 and Muslims being deadly, the top 7 deadliest countries for journalists are all more than 90% Muslim.Turkey is supposedly the moderate Muslim country, the one we want to let into the EU. And under Muslim President Erdogan, it has turned into a free speech nightmare. Private newspapers have been seized. Erdogan has criminalized \u201cinsults\u201d of himself not only within his own borders, but has attempted to crack down on those insulting him on YouTube and in Germany. Again: this is \u201cmoderate, secular Turkey.\u201dBut it\u2019s not just within Muslim countries that Islam and free speech butt heads.\nIn 2015 the Center for Security Policy commissioned a poll of Muslims in America. It found that 30% of American Muslims believe it is legitimate to use violence against those that insult Islam. And 33% said that sharia should take precedence over the constitution if they clashed. You know, the same constitution that stops feminists from putting you in jail for trolling people, like they do in Britain.According to a Wenzel Strategies poll in 2012.The entire world loves Malala, the Nobel Prize winning champion of education for girls. But look at her opinion, which passes in the media as moderate: \u201cThe more you speak about Islam and against all Muslims, the more terrorists we create.\u201dSo Malala\u2019s opinion is if we all just shut up and did what Islam wants, which is to submit, they wouldn\u2019t need to shoot us, stab us, or blow us up.That\u2019s the general sentiment of non-Muslim Americans toward criticism of Islam: \u201cDon\u2019t criticize Islam too harshly, or they might kill you.\u201d That is not an attitude conducive to freedom. That is an attitude of authoritarianism. That was the attitude held by German citizens under Hitler. That was the attitude held by Soviet citizens under Stalin.We hear a lot about moderate Muslims, but in practice we don\u2019t see them. All the moderate Muslims I know are ex-Muslims, or haven\u2019t been to Friday prayers for months, or even years.London has elected a Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, who is praised as a moderate But many have been left wondering just how moderate he is.Khan banned sexy advertisements from the underground like the famous Protein World ads.Was this move really to combat body shaming, like feminists wanted? Or was it to make the underground more shariah-compliant?It is another one of these instances where feminism and Islam are right in line with one another on women\u2019s rights. The same posters banned by Sadiq Khan were protested by feminist activists who also wanted them banned. When it comes to sexy women, feminists and Islam both want the same thing.It\u2019s weird isn\u2019t it, that a religion where the men are so perverted is also a religion that tries to make women less sexy. But I guess it\u2019s not so surprising \u2014 instead of encouraging men to control themselves, Islam has instead for generations been telling women to cover up.There\u2019s a slight difference with feminism here \u2014 feminists absolutely do want to control men, by any means possible. But they also want to control women.That\u2019s why they told women to become lesbians in the 1970s in order to stick it to the patriarchy, it\u2019s why they lash out at women in the sex industry, and it\u2019s why they\u2019ve developed a movement \u2014 \u201cfat acceptance\u201d \u2014 that hates attractive women.Still, the results are the same. Islam, a killjoy religion, considers alcohol, drugs, and, in the case of ISIS, even cigarettes to be \u201charam.\u201dFeminism, a killjoy ideology, is trying to shut down frat parties, college game days, and drunken romantic trysts because it considers them to be part of \u201crape culture.\u201d Different excuses, same result.I suppose the key difference is that Islam hates sexy women, whereas fat, lesbianic feminists just hate sex. But there\u2019s one thing that they both clearly hate \u2014 other people having fun.Now, Islam\u2019s hatred of the west barely needs an introduction. It is one of the defining realities of our time. In Europe, after the suicidal decision to open the floodgates to Islam, ordinary citizens have faced terror attack after terror attack from crazed jihadis.As always, the media tries to avoid mentioning the attackers\u2019 origins. A Muslim kills people in Germany? Just a \u201cTanned German.\u201d A Muslim drives a truck through tourists in France, killing more than 50? Just a runaway truck attack.The terror attacks have died down, for now, but last summer, it seemed as if the west was being attacked every week.I\u2019ll be generous and say feminists don\u2019t hate the west quite as much as Muslims do. Not that the Weather Underground and other progressive groups didn\u2019t commit their fair share of terrorist attacks. But those guys are peaceful university professors now, so that\u2019s OK!Still, the loathing that feminists and other progressives have for the west, especially in the academy, is eerily similar to Islam.Here\u2019s a feminist professor doing something that would make Muslims cry tears of joy \u2014 take a look.That\u2019s right. She\u2019s taking down 9/11 memorial posters, on 9/11 memorial day. Her name is Margot Lovett, and she teaches women\u2019s studies and history at Saddleback College.The same professor once wrote that 9/11 was the result of \u201cU.S imperialism.\u201d She also endorsed a statement from the Black Radical Congress which blamed 9/11 on the \u201cgenocidal levels of death and destruction\u201d caused by the west.That\u2019s a professor at a western college, folks. Oh, and by the way, she makes over $170,000 in pay and benefits annually. And part of that is taxpayer funded.Feminism and Islam are the twin problems facing America today, which is why they are the two things I talk about most.As students on campus, you deal with the negative effects of feminism in the administration, in the classroom, and of course online.America hasn\u2019t yet felt the full effects of Islam. Terror attacks like the Pulse nightclub shooting are terrible \u2014 and preventable \u2014 tragedies, but you will know what I mean if it reaches the point of London, where you don\u2019t feel safe in your home city.Let alone France, which is now full of no-go zones and should be crossed off your tourist bucket list unless you love rape culture and immigrants openly defecating in the street.The good news is we continue to make great strides in the culture war. Many of you are not afraid to be on campus and let people know you support Donald Trump and the dangerous faggot.Many of you aren\u2019t even afraid to say you support equality between the sexes, the worst nightmare of feminists and Muslims.", "date": "12 Oct 2016, 4:33 PM PDT", "title": "FULL TEXT: MILO At WCU On Feminism And Islam, The Unholy Alliance", "tags": ["Milo", "Tech", "Dangerous Faggot Tour", "Islam", "Western Carolina University"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/10/12/full-text-milo-wcu-feminism-islam-unholy-alliance/"}, {"id": "post-5253702", "author": "Charlie Nash", "content": "One user is alleged to have remotely erased Podesta\u2019s iPhone\u00a0after accessing his Apple account, which contained Podesta\u2019s phone number, address, and various email accounts.Do @TheDemocrats know nothing about security?

This awards him the best chance of any Republican in this best-of-nine, so a win by him would give Republicans one of the five wins they need on this table to retain the U.S. Senate.While Silver\u2019s projections and RealClearPolitics\u2019 averages are both well-balanced, they do account for some polls that are several days old, and thus often lag behind big events like the release of the video of Donald Trump using vulgar language, or the ensuing debate when he at the very least well surpassed expectations.Therefore, a look at the very latest poll (the right-hand column) can show a potential emerging trend, or be an outlier. Contrary to the accepted narrative of GOP chances of control collapsing in recent days, on average these nine candidates run a couple of points ahead based only on the most recent day of polling in all nine races.With Democrats telling The Hill they will now pick-up at least seven seats and widespread stories about Republican divisions hurting the GOP, one would expect the latest polls to show the GOP Senate candidates tanking. However, as of this snapshot that is not the case.If the Republicans win the three states in which they have at least a couple of point advantage (Florida, Missouri and Nevada), they would only need an additional two wins to keep the Senate.While North Carolina, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania are all extremely close, it is notable that the most recent poll in each of those three states the Republican owns a lead of between four and six points \u2014 so win two of those three in addition to the first three in the table, and Republicans win control.Even the Indiana and Wisconsin\u00a0races, where the Democrats have an\u00a0edge of at least a few points, the most recent polls had each Republican within two points.The presidential race to determine whether Tim Kaine or Mike Pence can break ties in the Senate is the most favorable of the nine for the Democrats based on polling at this time, but even if they win the White House they will need four more wins on this table to take the Senate.Put it all together as of Wednesday night, and RealClearPolitics projects a 52-49 Republican edge based on their averages as well as if you just go by their most recent day of polling in each of the nine races, while Nate Silver gives\u00a0the Republicans a 44 percent chance to control the U.S. Senate.In short, the Senate is almost a 50-50 chance right now \u2026Cubs at 33 percent Chance\u2026 which is a better chance than Cubs Nation has of celebrating for the first time in 108 years the week before the election.The Cubs are viewed as the best team in baseball, and are the \u201cfavorite\u201d for the World Series. However, just like this year\u2019s election, favorite does not mean better than 50 percent.VegasInsider.com\u00a0indicates the following chances of each of the remaining five teams winning the World Series:33% Chicago Cubs \u2013\u00a0chance of winning World series (8-5 builds in bookie cut)\n29% Toronto Blue Jays 19/10\n21% Cleveland Indians 3/1\n10% Washington Nationals 15/2\n7% Los Angeles Dodgers 12/1The Dodgers and Nationals play tomorrow to determine who faces the Cubs in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series for the right to face the Indians-Blue Jays winner in the World Series.With the Ohio State Buckeyes now pulling to even odds with Alabama, Clevelanders could run the table with the Cavaliers\u2019 NBA title, a winning bid for the Republican National Convention, a World Series title, and another College National Football championship.\u201cMistake on the Lake\u201d no more!", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 3:00 AM PDT", "title": "Hardball Politics: GOP Enjoys Better Odds of Retaining Senate Than Cubs Do of Winning World Series", "tags": ["2016 Presidential Race", "Big Government", "Breitbart Sports", "Chicago Cubs", "GOP Control", "Political Odds", "Sports Odds", "US Senate Control"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2016/10/13/best-5-9-us-senate-control/"}, {"id": "post-5255542", "author": "Daniel J.

Baez got booed off the field.Daniel Murphy\u2019s single off Luis Avilan dropped between Toles and Joc Pederson in left-center field, scoring two runs to tie it at 5. Avilan also heard boos.Joe Blanton, who earned the win, retired Anthony Rendon on a swinging strikeout to end the inning.\u201cOur bullpen has been unbelievable,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cJoe did what Joe\u2019s been doing all season.

NL East champions in three of the past five years, the Nationals were unable to advance during their two previous trips to the postseason.\u201cThat\u2019s why we fought so hard for the home-field advantage,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThis year, it\u2019s coming to fruition.\u201dDesperate to avoid another early playoff exit, the Dodgers went with Kershaw, their three-time Cy Young Award winner who won Game 1 last Friday despite going just five innings and allowing three runs.This time, he was charged with five runs and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out 11 \u2014 equaling his second-best postseason total \u2014 and walked two.The left-hander was limited to 149 innings while compiling a 1.69 ERA during the regular season. He missed 2 1/2 months with a mildly herniated disk in his back.Kershaw opened the game by giving up a leadoff single and a walk before Murphy\u2019s RBI single.The Dodgers took a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the inning on Gonzalez\u2019s two-run shot that scored Justin Turner, who was hit by a pitch from Joe Ross.Werth\u2019s RBI single tied it 2-all in the third.Los Angeles again answered in the bottom of the inning, with Kershaw getting the rally going with a double to left field. He slid into second and clenched his fists in a rare show of emotion.Kershaw scored on Turner\u2019s single with two outs. Pederson got hit by a pitch from Ross with the bases loaded, forcing in TurnerRoss made his postseason debut for the Nationals, giving up four runs and three hits in 2 2/3 innings, equaling the shortest playoff start in the history of the Montreal-Washington franchise. The 23-year-old right-hander struck out three and walked two. He hasn\u2019t pitched more than four innings since coming off the disabled list on Sept. 18.LOOK OUT!Five players were hit by pitches, including four Dodgers, which set a single-game franchise playoff record. Of the quartet, two ended up scoring. Werth was the lone Nationals player to get hit.There have been 11 hit batters in the series, a postseason record.\u201cNo one on either side is trying to hit anybody with everything on the line right now,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cThat\u2019s just baseball being played at its highest.\u201dTRAINER\u2019S ROOMNationals RHP Stephen Strasburg experienced discomfort in his right elbow during a bullpen session Monday at Dodger Stadium.

I believe you\u2019ve got to do it at the beginning of the week just because of how reps are distributed.\u201dKelly insisted the move was \u201ca football decision\u201d and had nothing to do with Kaepernick\u2019s current contract negotiations.Late in September the coach insisted that Kaepernick has been rebounding satisfactorily from his recent injuries and even said the QB\u2019s\u00a0underweight condition as a result of his newly adopted vegan diet was being addressed. But until this week Kelly had also warned that Kaepernick was not quite ready to \u201cgo full time.\u201dHowever,\u00a0after losing his fourth game in a row, Kelly decided to implement a shake up knocking former starter, Blaine Gabbert, down to back up. So far this year Gabbert\u2019s completed pass ratio stands\u00a0at 58 percent for a total of 890 yards. He has successfully completed five touchdowns but had six interceptions in his five starts this year.

He also has 38 rushing yards on his four carries.Coach Kelly confirmed that Christian Ponder will remain the No. 3 QB.Still, thus far this season, Kaepernick has made far more news for his stand against America than his playing.

They were arrested for a February 2012 concert at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow, where they sang a song called Punk Prayer that included a great deal of foul language and criticized the Orthodox Church for supporting Vladimir Putin.The criminal charge leveled against them was for \u201chooliganism motivated by religious hatred,\u201d not opposition to Putin, although many in Russia felt that was the true\u00a0reason for their incarceration. Others criticized the religious-hatred law, which has also been controversially invoked against individuals such as the atheist blogger busted for playing Pokemon Go in a cathedral.They became free-speech celebrities after two of them remained in jail, to eventually be released under an amnesty law in 2014.The similarity Amanpour sees between any of that and Donald Trump is unclear. Is anyone who runs into trouble for using vulgar language experiencing a \u201cPussy Riot moment?\u201d Or are the women who have accused Trump of inappropriate behavior supposed to be Pussy Riot in this joke?Despite his humble protest of having limited familiarity with English idiom, Lavrov\u2019s use of the term \u201cpussy\u201d was much less ambiguous.For what it\u2019s worth, the rest of the interview included Lavrov denying allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. election, although he said it was \u201cflattering\u201d that U.S. officials think Russia has such capability.\u201cIt\u2019s flattering, of course, to get this kind of attention \u2014 for a regional power, as President Obama called us some time ago.\u00a0Now everybody in the United States is saying that it is Russia which is running the presidential debate,\u201d said Lavrov, needling Obama for his former dismissal of Moscow as a serious global adversary.", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 8:08 PM PDT", "title": "Russian Foreign Minister Laments: 'So Many Pussies' in U.S. Presidential Race", "tags": ["2016 Presidential Race", "National Security", "Christiane Amanpour", "Donald Trump", "pussy riot", "Russia", "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/13/russian-foreign-minister-many-pussies-around-presidential-campaign-sides/"}, {"id": "post-5256682", "author": "Neil W.

Could that have changed the result and led to a prosecution?The Judicial Watch FOIA request aims for Clinton\u2019s \u201cDatto device.\u201dThe FOIA request asks for:Any and all records, including but not limited to emails or text messages (SMSs, MMSs, BBMs, iMessages, etc.), discovered, recovered, retrieved from, or found on any Datto device.Any and all records concerning or relating to the FBI\u2019s efforts to discover, recover, retrieve, or find emails or text messages stored on the Datto device, equipment or hardware reference in Request No. 1.What is a Datto device?Breitbart News reported in October of last year:Yesterday we learned that Hillary Clinton\u2019s home-brew email server was using an online backup service called Datto, Inc. to create copies of her data \u2013 a hair-raising proposition, given that Clinton\u2019s server improperly contained classified and Top Secret material, made even more alarming by the fact that Clinton\u2019s computer company didn\u2019t realize\u00a0her machine was still communicating with Datto until shortly before they surrendered it to the FBI.Hillary Clinton\u2019s server was stored by a computer company in Denver called Platte River Networks, while Datto is based in Connecticut.Wednesday afternoon, Datto announced it had turned over a \u201chardware device\u201d to the FBI, along with all Clinton emails the company had in its possession.\u201cWith the consent of our client and their end user, and consistent with our policies regarding data privacy, yesterday, Tuesday, October 6, Datto delivered a hardware device to the FBI containing all backed up data related to Platte Rivers Networks\u2019 client known to be in its possession,\u201d said the company.", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 5:07 PM PDT", "title": "FBI Served with Request for Hillary's Backup Device...Object Is in FBI's Possession", "tags": ["2016 Presidential Race", "Big Government", "Hillary Clinton", "Hillary Clinton"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/13/fbi-served-with-request-for-hillarys-backup-device-object-is-in-fbis-possession/"}, {"id": "post-5195271", "author": "Breitbart TV", "content": "Thursday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will hold a rally in Cincinnati, OH at 7:30 p.m. ET at\u00a0the U.S. Bank Arena.Follow Breitbart.tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 3:30 PM PDT", "title": "Watch Live: Donald Trump in Cincinnati", "tags": ["2016 Presidential Race", "Breitbart TV", "Cincinnati", "Donald Trump", "ohio"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/10/13/watch-live-donald-trump-cincinnati/"}, {"id": "post-5265227", "author": "Pam Key", "content": "Thursday in Waterloo, IA, while campaigning for his wife Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, former President Bill Clinton told a protestor shouting, \u201cYou\u2019re a rapist\u201d that his \u201cproblem\u201d was his choice in media outlets.Clinton said, \u201cGive that guy a hand.

Ryan, after tapes of Trump making lewd comments about women leaked over last weekend before the debate on Sunday night where Trump rebounded again, aimed to undermine Trump once again.Ryan did not congratulate Trump on winning the debate, and has signaled to Republicans in Congress his intention to abandon the GOP presidential nominee right before the election. He did, however, fall in line behind the Trump campaign\u2019s message on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s campaign staff\u2019s attacks against Catholic voters as evidenced by WikiLeaks emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Nonetheless, with the exception of that moment, Ryan has been systematically targeting Trump\u2014and ignoring Clinton entirely\u2014on the campaign trail.Gingrich, however, wants Trump to ignore the fact that the entire political establishment\u2014including the mainstream media and even elements of the Republican establishment in Washington, D.C.\u2014have been trying to sabotage his campaign.

That admission is coupled with the revelation of how exactly\u2014over a months-long period\u2014her campaign staff helped her maneuver through her position change on the explosive issue. And all of that is mixed together with the admission in writing in these emails by her campaign manager Robby Mook that Hillary Clinton would not be \u201ccomfortable\u201d coming out against TPP during the campaign, even though she had to do it for votes. These emails indicate just how seriously her team of political operatives took the issue\u2014and how they viewed it, as Mook said in one email, as an \u201cannoying\u201d issue in terms of timing\u2014in terms of not infuriating labor unions, which by and large oppose such trade deals. Clinton has had a rocky relationship with Big Labor, as other emails have shown her campaign staff\u2019s frustration with union bosses like the AFL-CIO\u2019s Richard Trumka.Clinton\u2019s pollster John Anzalone admitted in the clearest possible language that the goal in manicuring Clinton\u2019s newfound position against TPP was for political purposes to get on the side of voters. In one email, Anzalone detailed how it\u2019s clear that Clinton would lose an \u201cintegrity gold star\u201d by not \u201cstaying pure\u201d in her support of the TPP and the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) that would fast track congressional consideration of TPP and other deals. He also noted that Clinton previously supported the deal in her book Hard Choices, and hinted at the 45 times she previously promoted the deal as reported by CNN. The thinking of coming out against TPP was that it would get Clinton \u201cright with voters\u201d and \u201cright with labor,\u201d as the general public and labor unions both oppose trade deals like TPP, regardless of her actual position on the deal.\u201cI talked to Marlon [Marshall, Clinton\u2019s director of state campaigns and political engagement] today about this,\u201d Anzalone wrote to Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook on April 13, 2015, around 2:45 p.m. He went on:Naturally we should not be making this decision in a policy vacuum or just because we are concerned about a story of her changing her mind or taking on Obama. It is so much bigger than this. Getting on the wrong side of Labor on the only issue they care about has ramifications on the ground in these early states. I say we suck it up and be as definitive as possible from the beginning that we don\u2019t like these deals. We will be right with voters and right with labor. We get no integrity gold star for staying pure on this issue because of one line if friggin Hard Choices or because this is a key issue for a lame duck president.A previous email exchange in March 2015 detailed how Clinton\u2019s staff believed she intended to support both TPA and TPP. The email from her lead speechwriter makes it very clear: The draft letter he was circulating \u201cassumes that she\u2019s ultimately going to support both TPA and TPP.\u201d\u201cAll, I want to share our draft letter on trade,\u201d Clinton speechwriter Dan Schwerin wrote to Podesta and Mook among others on the Clinton team. Schwerin continued:As you\u2019ll recall, the idea here is to use this to lay out her thinking on TPA & TPP ahead of action on the Hill and a joint letter by all the former Secretaries of State and Defense. This draft assumes that she\u2019s ultimately going to support both TPA and TPP. It focuses on what needs to happen to produce a positive result with TPP, and casts support for TPA as one of those steps. It also says that we should walk away if the final agreement doesn\u2019t meet the test of creating more jobs than it displaces, helping the middle class, and strengthening our national security. We\u2019ve tried to speak directly to the most prominent concerns expressed by Labor and Hill Dems, including Warren. Of course, if we go ahead with a meeting with HRC to lay out the pros and cons and then come to a different conclusion, this letter would change dramatically.To set the scene here, at this stage of the game, Congress was soon going to be considering the highly controversial TPA fast track authority. Fast track greases the skids for congressional approval of trade deals, lowering U.S. Senate vote thresholds to 51 votes rather than 60 votes needed to pass them. It also eliminates the ability for Congress to amend trade deals, and forces Congress to consider trade deals in a certain amount of time after the president introduces them onto the fast track. It is widely understood that passing TPA is absolutely necessary to passing any multilateral global trade deal, as no deal would muster 60 votes in the Senate or survive a grueling amendment process where opponents could run out the clock. Killing TPA would have killed TPP, but technically speaking TPP can still be killed\u2014even though it still hasn\u2019t been\u2014in a much harder way on the fast track.Congressional passage of TPA last year inspired a surge in populist nationalism that served as the backbone of the presidential campaigns of eventual GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump and of Clinton\u2019s primary rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. From both sides, Clinton\u2014the former Secretary of State, former U.S. Senator and former First Lady who\u2019s married to a former president known for backing globalist trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)\u2014has taken incoming on trade policy. The issue nuked the last man standing against Trump in the GOP primaries, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), whose ambivalence was part of what cost him the nomination. And it certainly had the potential to derail Clinton in her battle against Sanders.These emails indicate that her staff understood that Clinton was in favor of TPP. Specifically, in her book Hard Choices\u2014as Anzalone referenced in that April 13, 2015, email\u2014Clinton praised the TPP as beneficial to American workers.\u00a0Hillary Clinton wrote:One of our most important tools for engaging with Vietnam was a proposed new trade agreement called the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would link markets throughout Asia and the Americas, lowering trade barriers while raising standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property. As President Obama explained, the goal of TPP negotiations is to establish \u2018a high standard, enforceable, meaningful trade agreement\u2019 that \u2018is going to be incredibly powerful for American companies who, up until this point, have often been locked out of those markets.\u2019 It was also important for American workers who would benefit from competing on a more level playing field. And it was a strategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia.That was in addition to at least 45 other times she praised and promoted TPP, as reported on June 15, 2015, by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and his reporting staff. Clinton would not actually officially oppose TPP until October 2015, stating according to CNN in an Oct. 7, 2015 interview with PBS\u2019 sJudy Woodruff: \u201cAs of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.\u201dThat means a months-long internal process eventually led to her coming out against the deal she originally supported and helped negotiate\u2014and concerns as to whether she is truly against it remain. In fact, Trump surrogate and TPP opponent Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) on Thursday morning railed against Clinton on the issue on Breitbart News Daily\u2014saying that if Clinton wins she will \u201cmake a few cosmetic changes, say the thing is fixed, and try to move it [the TPP] through Congress.\u201d\u201cAs Secretary of State, she helped write the dadgum thing. So give me a break. She\u2019s praised it,\u201d Sessions said.Mook forwarded that Anzalone email on April 13, 2015, to Podesta around 10 p.m. that evening, saying that he agreed with Anzalone\u2014but that Clinton herself would not be \u201ccomfortable\u201d locking herself in against TPP.\u201cJohn articulated my thoughts better than I did\u2026but I know the boss won\u2019t be comfortable putting her foot down,\u201d Mook wrote to Podesta.All of this discussion that day\u2014April 13, 2015\u2014came in response to an email that Clinton\u2019s senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan sent shortly after 8 a.m. on the different mechanisms to come out against TPP:For TPA/TPP, we have three options.*1. The Podesta/Jake option leads with supporting giving the President authority but indicating concern with the open-ended grant of authority. Podesta would add a bracketed sentence declaring opposition to the Wyden bill.*I called Senator Wyden. I told him I believe that President Obama should have the authority to negotiate a good TPP deal that delivers for the middle class, but I don\u2019t support extending that authority for years beyond this administration and this trade agreement. [And therefore I can\u2019t support his bill.]But the key question for me is not the procedure \u2013 it\u2019s what\u2019s in the final agreement. It has to pass two tests: First, does it protect American workers, raise wages and create more good jobs at home than it displaces? And second, does it also strengthen our national security? If the agreement falls short of these tests, we should be willing to walk away. The goal is greater prosperity for American families, not trade for trade\u2019s sake.There are a number of pivotal questions to be decided in the coming months: from improving labor rights, the environment, public health, and access to life-saving medicines; to cracking down on currency manipulation and unfair competition by state-owned enterprises; to opening new opportunities for our family farms and small businesses to export their products and services overseas. Getting these things right will go a long way toward ensuring that a final agreement will be a net plus for everyday Americans.We also have to get dispute settlement provisions right. So-called \u201cinvestor-state dispute settlement,\u201d or ISDS, lets individual companies bring cases to enforce trade agreements. In the past, ISDS has benefited some American companies by letting them challenge unfair actions by foreign governments. But as I warned in my book, *Hard Choices*, we shouldn\u2019t allow multinational corporations to use ISDS to undermine legitimate health, social, economic, and environmental regulations, as Philip Morris has tried to do in Australia.So I\u2019ll be watching closely to see how negotiations develop.*2. The Jen P. option would lead with TPP and then come to procedure.*The key question for me is not the procedure \u2013 it\u2019s what\u2019s in the final agreement.

I don\u2019t support a broad grant of trade authority that extends for years beyond this administration and this trade agreement. I think this President should have the authority to drive a hard bargain on TPP, but this broader bill doesn\u2019t work from my perspective.As for TPP, I\u2019m going to set a very high bar. It has to pass two tests: First, does it protect American workers, raise wages and create more good jobs at home than it displaces? And second, does it also strengthen our national security?

And in his email, he noted that Clinton may face \u201chistorical blowback on her past position\u201d due to her flip-flopping on TPP.Anzalone wrote in an email that included Sullivan, Podesta, Jennifer Palmieri, Mook, Joel Benenson, Mandy Grunwald, Jim Margolis, Dan Schwerin, Kristina Schake, Marlon Marshall, and Amanda Renteria:I am for three because it sends the strongest signal not only Labor but to where voters are on trade. They feel they always get the raw end of the deal. I am less concerned about historical blowback on her past position than this issue eating us alive for being on the wrong side and giving Progressives a real reason to try and push someone more weighty into the primary. There are no other issues that Labor cares about. This is it for them and they actually have voters on their side.Margolis replied that he supported a mix of options two and three.\u201cI\u2019m for principle first, process second,\u201d Margolis wrote. \u201cSo I\u2019d go Jen, with the harder hit at the end from Robby. Closing with \u2018I called Senator Wyden. I told him I can\u2019t support his bill.\u201dMook greenlighted the Margolis plan, writing \u201cI\u2019m good with Margolis\u2019 plan\u201d before a discussion ensued\u2014initiated by Benenson\u2014about how Hillary Clinton was having trouble with labor unions.\u201cWe clearly need a bigger strategic discussion about how to deal with labor as a constituency,\u201d Benenson wrote.Mook assured the team that was under way, as Renteria and Marshall were heading up an effort to do just that. \u201cMarlon and Amanda are putting together a plan to reach out quickly whenever she steps out on this to frame for them on our terms,\u201d he replied.Back on March 25, 2015, Schwerin circulated that internal draft letter on trade policy that assumed she would support TPP and TPA.March 25 Letter by Breitbart News on ScribdLater, on April 5, 2015, eight days before this effort to begin coming out against TPP slightly\u2014a process that would take until at least October and to some is still ongoing\u2014the Clinton team revised her position, circulating a new letter on trade that included her opposing ISDS, or Investor State Dispute Settlement, a hot-button issue for unions. The email chain was discussing how Congress was soon going to be considering TPA.In that April 5 email chain, Mook specifically noted he was worried that unions would be shaming Clinton off the bat in her campaign.\u201cThe timing is so annoying,\u201d Mook wrote of congressional TPA consideration. \u201cSteps right on launch. Would be a shame to have labor booing her right out of the gate.\u201dAlong with the April 5 chain there were two separate revisions to the draft trade letters that were circulated\u2014one on April 5 and another on April 6.April 5 Letter by Breitbart News on ScribdApril 6 Letter by Breitbart News on Scribd\nBefore getting to that April 13 point where they seem to eventually start shifting against TPP and TPA, another leaked email chain from April 11 indicates that the Clinton campaign staffers were still hand wringing\u2014searching for a way to get to a \u201cpure dodge\u201d in the media.At 2:09 a.m, on April 11, Jake Sullivan circulated draft remarks from Clinton he pitched as the \u201cPodesta approach\u201d on trade:Look, I\u2019m focused on the final deal, and whether it will measure up. If it does, I\u2019ll support it. If it doesn\u2019t, I won\u2019t.TPA is about Senate procedure \u2013 and in any event it\u2019s just a draft proposal making its way through a Senate committee. I want to focus on the substance: will TPP be a good deal, or not? We haven\u2019t seen the details so we can\u2019t answer that question yet.Let me say this about TPA. I believe that President Obama should have the negotiating authority to conclude a transpacific agreement that works for the American middle class and advances American leadership. But I don\u2019t believe we should give an open-ended fast track to the next president. I hope I\u2019m the next president, and I think I should have to justify fast track to the new Congress. And if a Republican is the next president, I certainly don\u2019t want to give fast track to them now \u2013 heck, that\u2019s why I voted against fast track for President Bush.These are all procedural issues. The key for me is whether the final deal passes two tests: pass two tests: First, does it raise wages and create more good jobs at home than it displaces? And second, does it also strengthen our national security? Let\u2019s wait and see that final deal.At 6:28 a.m., Palmieri wrote back saying that she was looking for more of a \u201cdodge\u201d than what Sullivan pitched:Boo!My impression of the Podesta approach was more of a dodge then what you have here.For example, if she weighs in on length of the TPA I think that will be viewed as passive opposition. Now what you propose would be more popular with dems and labor and closer to her view \u2013 so maybe okay, just want to consider that dynamic.Think this is worth getting on the phone today to discuss.At 6:53 a.m., Sullivan responded that what he pitched was something that would be \u201csustainable\u201d if the campaign couldn\u2019t get away with a \u201cpure dodge\u201d:This is a alternative if we can\u2019t do pure dodge.

What we\u2019ll give the 2016 candidates on November 8th is our vote\u2014not our opinions, not our emotions and certainly not our endorsements. Most don\u2019t deserve that.Your vote is not an endorsement. This isn\u2019t about your emotions. It\u2019s about your future. It is a choice for the strategic and practical direction of your country.The process for choosing our nation\u2019s leaders has become less about vision and viability and more about personalities. \u201cLikability\u201d is now the determining factor for electability. However, the 2016 election cannot digress into a popularity contest. There is too much at stake.We should choose a leader that prioritizes directness, not weakness\u2014who cherishes authenticity, not duplicity.The American people must vote for capability, not likability.A sensationalist\u2019s dream.\u00a0It was a weekend for the proverbial history books: \u201cscandalous\u201d Trump tapes from 2005, a damning document dump by WikiLeaks on Hillary Clinton, and the second presidential debate.As for the debate, Trump handily beat Hillary in the town-hall style forum with a better understanding of reality and a commanding, authentic and presidential tone.The most historic moment of the night? Responding to Hillary\u2019s attack that she\u2019s thankful her opponent isn\u2019t (yet) running the country, Trump said, \u201cYeah, because you\u2019d be in jail.\u201dA pay-per-view MMA round couldn\u2019t have packed this much punch.But with 27 days till the election, we continue to hear groaning over the poor candidate matchup. Cries for a third-party option have come from friends leaning left and right. Are we the only ones remembering the near-record voter turnout that delivered these two candidates?Groaning aside, it\u2019s time to RSVP for November 8th. It\u2019s time to vote. Sure, at this election dinner table, you could ignore the options of chicken or fish and write in vegetarian. You\u2019ll feel good about your choice, but you\u2019re still eating chicken or fish.In 2012, one out of every 20 Christian voters stayed home protesting Mormon presidential candidate, Mitt Romney. Four years later, we have a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of principled voters throwing the election and their vote away.Sit home or vote, either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be your president.Let\u2019s try a different approach.You\u2019re electing a President, not a friend or a pastor.Mainstream comedian, Lewis Black, explains candidly that if you could see yourself having a beer with one of the candidates, vote for the other person.Picking a president because he or she is a nice person is absurd\u2014not to mention irresponsible. That would be like stacking your fantasy football team with the nicest guys in the league instead of the best, most strategic players. Ask Tim Tebow how well that worked out.Trump and Clinton may not perfectly align with your moral convictions, but a strategic vote means electing a Commander-in-Chief who aligns with at least some of them. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was an obese, womanizing drunk well known for his terse remarks and offensive gestures.However, his personality and stubbornness was perfectly tailored to leading Great Britain to victory in World War II\u2014which President Obama may have forgotten since he removed the Churchill bust from the Oval Office.The man who told us, \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for you country,\u201d was the same man who was recorded saying, \u201cIf I don\u2019t have a woman for three days, I get a terrible headache.\u201dJohn F. Kennedy is buried in Arlington Cemetery and the nation burns an eternal flame in his honor. Without him, we may have never landed on the moon, nor reached for the stars.We are imperfect people choosing imperfect leaders to run an imperfect nation.Make a strategic choice.\u00a0We\u2019re not taught to vote smart. We have been conditioned to vote based on feelings and reaction, rather than preemptive action.As Americans, voting should be the most practical choice we make. You will never see a candidate on the ballot that perfectly represents your principles and priorities.Each election represents a step towards the end zone. Whether it was Civil Rights reform or women\u2019s suffrage, social change happens over time\u2014as does the downfall of a society.We make practical decisions everyday. For example, most Apple iPhone users gobbled up the recent iPhone 7 despite widespread reports of declining work conditions for Chinese factory workers.Users continue to overlook their personal objections because functional technology outweighs their social concern.Elections are no different. We decide to align with candidates despite knowing the dirty underbelly of the system. We recognize that there are reasons for disagreement and even disgust.We should never discount character. In fact, it is an essential quality in a president. The ability to make just, moral decisions during our country\u2019s darkest hours determine America\u2019s destiny.\u00a0So what do we do in 2016? \u00a0The elites have confused self-righteousness with being right.More than 100 establishment Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, pulled their support for Trump at the revelation of his 2005 statements. Don\u2019t be fooled by their press statements. This isn\u2019t about their principles and it isn\u2019t about the Constitution. To them, there\u2019s one thing that matters more than the Constitution.Getting reelected.Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University and son of Jerry Falwell Sr. said, \u201cI just think some of the \u2026 establishment folks who reluctantly endorsed [Trump] had this planned all along as a way to slither out of the endorsement, and I think it backfired on them, and I\u2019m glad to see that.\u201dFor the Republican elites, it\u2019s power first, principles second.Given the choice before us, Hillary is not the most practical, strategic vote for America. She\u2019s a step backwards for our economy, an active threat to our safety and security, and an enemy to our Constitutional rights. Hillary failed to even mention the Constitution in the last debate when discussing Supreme Court nominees.Trump, however, is the most practical move for the future of America. He\u2019s the only candidate who is concrete on core issues. With priorities like decreasing the debt, appointing Constitution-focused Supreme Court justices, strengthening our southern border, destroying ISIS and ridding the nation of destructive political correctness, Trump lives in reality.Donald Trump is the Republican nominee because America is tired of the elites. Let\u2019s put aside the feelings of today, and think about our nation two, five, and 10 years down the road.Trump is the practical vote and a real first down for principles.Brian Bosch\u00e9 is a former national journalist and #1 bestselling author of the book, 13 Reasons to Give a Damn in 2016.

But Thatcher scored positively for her foreign policy legacy, whereas Cameron was given a score of -69, behind even Tony Blair who led Britain into the second Iraq War.Prof. Theakston, said: \u201cFor all his achievements as a successful coalition prime minister, David Cameron\u2019s reputation and place in history seems destined to be defined by Brexit and his calling and losing the referendum.\u201cAcademic opinion, as reflected in our survey, is currently pretty damning. But reputations can wax and wane as subsequent events, the passage of time and new evidence change perspectives.\u201cDepending on how Brexit works out, future historians and political scientists may come to a different verdict on Mr Cameron\u2019s premiership and his place in the league table of prime ministers.\u201dThe study repeats similar polling carried out in 2010 and 2004, before Cameron had taken the reins at No. 10.

Investigators have since said he was thought to have links with the Islamic State group.Early last Saturday, police closed in on him in the eastern city of Chemnitz, but he managed to slip away after they fired a warning shot.Police officers monitoring Bakr were reportedly so conspicuous that his neighbour noticed them too, Bild daily reported, adding that a police vehicle was openly parked in front of the apartment block.Police were later widely mocked after an investigator explained that officers could not chase Bakr because they were wearing 35 kilos worth of protective gear.Police discovered 1.5 kilos (over three pounds) of TATP, the homemade explosive that was used by IS jihadists in the Paris and Brussels attacks, in Bakr\u2019s flat.They said that he was preparing a \u201cbomb, possibly in the form of a suicide vest\u201d.Bakr was finally turned in late Sunday by three Syrian refugees who had overpowered and tied him up after realising that he was sought by police.Germany has been on edge since two IS-claimed attacks in July \u2014 an axe rampage on a train in Wuerzburg that injured five, and a suicide bombing in Ansbach in which 15 people were hurt.The bloodshed has fuelled concerns over Germany\u2019s record influx of nearly 900,000 refugees and migrants in 2015.", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 7:45 AM PDT", "title": "Airport Bomb Plot Suspect Hangs Self in German Police Cell", "tags": ["Breitbart London", "Breitbart TV", "Jihad", "Germany", "Islam", "Syria", "terrorism"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/10/13/airport-bomb-plot-hangs-self-german-police-cell/"}, {"id": "post-5259092", "author": "Donna Rachel Edmunds", "content": "The influx means London is likely to hit megacity status by 2025, up from a population figure of 8.2 million in 2011, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show.The study looked at eleven city regions across the UK and found that London was anomalous for a number of reasons.First and foremost was London\u2019s rate of growth \u2013 an astonishing 5.7 per cent between 2011 and 2015 \u2013 equivalent to an increase of more than half a million people in just four years. The figure is more than twice that seen on average across the other ten regions combined, while the rest of the UK, excluding the city regions, saw a population increase of only 2.5 per cent in the same period.The increase is predominantly being driven by international migration; on average each year between 2011 and 2015 London saw 192,000 foreign migrants arrive and 95,000 leave, giving a net figure of 97,000 over each of the four years.The headline figure, therefore, masks huge demographic shifts within the city, brought about in part through white flight. Census figures showed that some 620,000 native Britons have abandoned the city between 2001 and 2011, a trend which the ONS figures show continuing.As a result, London posted three times as much internal immigration out of London (that is, Londoners moving to other parts of the country) as the next most abandoned city region, the West Midlands, which includes the city of Birmingham. The figures were 3.1 per cent net of the 2011 population for London, against just less than 1 per cent net for Birmingham.Similarly, London was the only city in the study in which the net migration of children was negative, suggesting that families with young children in particular are abandoning the city, the report says likely in response to high house prices in the city.The report notes: \u201cOn most measures shown in this report, Greater London stands out. It is by far the UK\u2019s largest city region but is also the fastest growing. Its comparatively young population age structure means it has a higher birth rate and a lower death rate than other areas.\u201cIn addition its attraction as the UK capital, a major employment centre and international hub lead to much higher growth from international migration than any other area.\u201cFor internal migration, however, Greater London has a high net outflow. Uniquely among the city regions it has a high net internal inflow of people aged 22 to 29, reflecting its attraction for graduates in particular. But in other age groups larger numbers of people move out, with potential reasons including the high cost of property for people forming a family, plus lifestyle choices.\u201dLondon is already seeing huge differences on the ground as a result of the population shift. In a documentary filmed earlier this year locals in the borough of Newham, once the heart of London\u2019s cockney culture, described the area as \u201cBaghdad\u201d thanks to decades of immigration from India and Pakistan. Meanwhile locals have departed, mainly for Kent.Ethnic minorities make up 76 per cent of the borough\u2019s population, making it the most multicultural place in Britain, prompting one local to comment \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find somebody who speaks English in Newham.\u201d", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 6:53 AM PDT", "title": "High Immigration Levels Will See London Population Swell to 10 Million By 2025", "tags": ["Breitbart London", "Immigration", "Demographics", "immigration", "London", "population growth"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/10/13/high-immigration-levels-london-population-10-million-2025/"}, {"id": "post-5252392", "author": "Chris Tomlinson", "content": "Finance Minister Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling of the conservative Austrian People\u2019s Party (\u00d6VP) \u00a0announced that the state would be examining the bill for the housing and care of migrants, reports\u00a0Austrian broadcaster Oe24.The ministry of finance also released figures breaking down the costs of asylum seekers for the previous two years which were well below the two billion euros proposed in the budget.

The costs have risen in some areas to over 50,000 euros to deport one individual. Many North African countries have simply refused\u00a0to cooperate and take back their nationals.This new migrant deal with Tunisia, according to Avramopoulos, would function much in the same way as the European Union migrant deal with Turkey. \u00a0The Tunisians would accept more of their nationals back while the European Union would lift visa restrictions for Tunisian nationals who want to visit or work in the EU.The deal with Turkey has been fraught with problems since the outset and even though the deal has largely stopped the mass flow of migrants from Turkey into Greece, the visa liberalisation has so far not manifested into reality.The Turkish government has repeatedly threatened to allow the migrants to leave the country for Europe if they do not get visa-free travel while the EU maintains that Ankara must meet certain demands first.\u00a0", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 2:10 AM PDT", "title": "EU's Emergency Migrant Crisis Border Controls Will Expire Next Month", "tags": ["Breitbart London", "Immigration", "border controls", "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "Europe Migrant Crisis", "European Union", "Schengen Area"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/10/13/eu-internal-border-controls-likely-expire-november/"}, {"id": "post-5251542", "author": "Donna Rachel Edmunds", "content": "The father of the British man driving the car which struck the migrant on Sunday night has spoken out about the incident, describing a terrifying ordeal which he said had left both him and his son traumatised.The pair were headed towards the Eurostar terminal at about 8.30pm on Sunday night when a group of around 50 migrants who were attempting to block the road turned on their vehicle.\u201cIt was unbelievably terrifying,\u201d\u00a0Nafthali Reichman, a jeweller from\u00a0Stamford Hill in North London, told the Daily Mail.\u201cMy son is traumatised and so am\u00a0I.

Instead, he, his wife Nabila and their 7-month old infant are joining one of the last voluntary resettlement convoys bound for reception centres across France.\u201cWe just want a life, nothing more,\u201d Nasir told Reuters in broken English.A Union Jack flag painted on his caravan is a poignant reminder of Nasir\u2019s now-dashed dreams of a better life in Britain, barely 21 miles (33 km) away across the English Channel and the preferred destination of almost all migrants in Calais.No one knows for sure how many have made the perilous crossing from France to Britain, sometimes stowed away in the back of lorries or clinging to the undersides of trains.Thousands have however failed, including Nasir, thwarted by barbed wire-topped fencing lining the highway between the camp and the Calais ferry port, by police patrols as well as a battery of security cameras. Now a wall is being built on the port\u2019s approach road to serve as a further deterrent.President Francois Hollande said last month that France would completely shut down \u201cthe Jungle\u201d by the end of the year.

Most are from countries like Afghanistan, Sudan and Eritrea, and increasingly Syria.A small crowd encircled Nasir and exchanged farewells before a state worker drove the family to the bus waiting to transfer them to a reception centre in Merignac on the outskirts of Bordeaux in distant southwestern France.The migrants cannot choose where they end up and even as France prepares to shut the \u201cJungle\u201d, many still target Britain.\u201cEngland, England!\u201d shouted one Afghan teenager as Nasir bid his goodbyes.Ahead of a presidential election next April, Hollande has faced mounting public pressure to dismantle the camp and relocate its inhabitants. Conservative opponents have raised the heat, accusing the Socialist president of mismanaging a problem they say is ultimately a British one.Hollande reminded Britain two weeks ago that it had a role to play in managing the flow of migrants. He said that were France to stop preventing the migrants from leaving French soil, Britain would find itself obliged to deal with them when they landed on its shores.Vincent Berton, a senior official in the Calais town hall, described the camp closure as a \u201chumanitarian operation\u201d, and said that more than 6,000 Jungle migrants had been moved to reception centres in the past 12 months. An average of three bus-loads were leaving each week, he said.Yet Hollande\u2019s plans are meeting stiff local resistance in some towns where the 160 reception centres have been set up.Last week shots were fired at two planned migrant centres, one in the western seaside resort town of Saint Brevin and the other in Saint-Hilaire-du-Rosier in southeastern France, a conservative stronghold.In the southern village of Allex, the mayor sought to hold a local referendum on whether to accept its quota of 50 migrants before regional officials blocked the vote in court.Such resistance highlights the balancing act the government faces upholding humanitarian obligations and pleasing voters as Europe searches for a coherent response to the migration crisis.\u201cI want to stay in France, if France wants me,\u201d said Rawaz Rawchy, 33, an Iraqi Kurd, as he boarded the bus. \u201cWe have to leave now.

The two top vote-getters will then debate one-on-one before the November 27 run-off.US-style primaries are a relatively new phenomenon in France.The ruling Socialists were the first to experiment with the process in 2011, nominating Francois Hollande who went on to defeat the divisive Sarkozy in elections the following year.Four years later the Socialists are in disarray.Hollande, who is battling ratings unprecedentedly low for a post-war president, has yet to announce whether he will stand for re-election.Irrespective of his decision, polls already show the Socialists being the big losers of the election.National Front leader Le Pen, riding high on a nationalist, anti-migrant platform, is expected to place first or second in the first round of voting on April 23.The run-off is expected to pit her against either Juppe or Sarkozy, with the conservative candidate forecast to win the keys to the Elysee Palace.Sarkozy has made a series of populist proposals in recent days, notably pledging, if elected, to immediately hold a referendum on tightening immigration and jailing suspected Islamist radicals.Juppe, currently France\u2019s most popular politician, is taking the opposite tack, positioning himself as a unifier and a moderate.\u2013 Scandalous pasts \u2013With the Socialists given little to no chance of retaining the presidency, some frustrated leftist voters have said they plan to sneak into the conservative primary.\u201cMy main motivation is to block Nicolas Sarkozy,\u201d said Eric, a left-leaning sports teacher who plans to take advantage of loose participation rules to cast a vote for Juppe.Both right-wing frontrunners have been tarnished by scandal, though Sarkozy\u2019s are more recent and more numerous.The ex-president faces inquiries into alleged influence-peddling and suspected illegal funding of his failed 2012 election campaign.Juppe too was involved in a party finance scandal, for which he was convicted in 2004.Gael Sliman of the Odoxa polling firm told AFP the challenge for Sarkozy, as the outsider, was \u201cnot to go overboard\u201d during the debate.Juppe, on the other hand, \u201cshould put himself above the fray, without coming across as arrogant.\u201d", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 1:17 AM PDT", "title": "Sarkozy and Juppe Set for French Presidential Primary Showdown", "tags": ["Breitbart London", "France", "Nicolas Sarkozy"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/10/13/sarkozy-juppe-set-french-presidential-primary-showdown/"}, {"id": "post-5257522", "author": "Thomas D.

Yet according to Jo Johnson, head of private and overseas patients at the hospital, four in five foreign patients abscond before paying for their treatment.In board papers seen by the Health Service Journal, she said that the hospital had recently become aware that it was being targeted by overseas agents.\u201cThe problem is escalating within obstetrics and we have just been made aware that individuals are currently offering paid assistance to women in Nigeria to have their babies for free on the NHS at St George\u2019s,\u201d she said.Hospital managers have now said that women would have to present passports at their 12-week scan or at an antenatal appointment, stressing that women in labour would not be turned away.Women will have to show that they have lived in the UK for six months at least in order to be eligible for free care. Those who are not will not be able to continue with maternity treatment, and may be eligible for deportation.A spokesman for the Department of Health has welcomed the scheme, but pointed out that all hospitals should be asking for passports anyway \u2013 the Department issued new guidelines only last year advising that proof of identity ought to be sought for any patient before treatment.Many hospitals have ignored the guidelines, however, either thanks to staff shortages or because they assume patients are eligible for treatment.But a spokesman from St George\u2019s said the hospital planned to stick to the guidelines and needed to be more vigilant thanks to the large numbers of health tourists it had already treated.Overall, health tourism is thought to cost the NHS \u00a3200 million a year for all types of treatment.

The first one, Kunduz city, fell twice, but it is allegedly once again under the control of the Afghans.WSJ adds that Afghan security forces are being stretched thin as they respond to Taliban attacks in provincial capitals across the country.According to the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a U.S. watchdog agency appointed by Congress, the U.S.-backed Afghan troops, who are in the lead of security operations despite facing capability gaps, are being sent into battle with some \u201cghost\u201d troops, a move that limits the number of actual troops on the ground therefore endangering the lives of Afghan and American service members doing the actual fighting.\u201cNeither the United States nor our Afghan allies truly know how many Afghan soldiers and police are available for duty, or, by extension, the true nature of their operational capability,\u201d SIGARtold lawmakers in April 2015.SIGAR estimated that of the 319,595 troops who are supposed to be in the ANDSF, nearly 200,000 are \u201cghost\u201d forces whose salaries are being collected by corrupt officials.In Helmand alone, Aqa Noor Kintoz, the provincial police chief, said in June that up to half of the tens of thousands of the ANDSF troops who had been deployed to his province at the time were \u201cghost.\u201dHis predecessor was accused of \u201cexploiting his official powers, establishing ghost police and underestimating his responsibilities in the war with insurgents,\u201d reported TOLO News.There is no longer mention of tens of thousands of troops in Helmand in recent news articles.Helmand is one of the deadliest regions of the ongoing war for U.S.-led coalition and Afghan forces.\u00a0 As the largest and top opium producing province, it is an important source of funding for the Taliban, estimated to generate billions.It is also located in southern Afghanistan along the Pakistan border, making it easier for Taliban jihadists to escape into sanctuaries allegedly sanctioned by Islamabad.Reuters reports:Afghan officials say security forces are losing as many as 5,000 people each month through casualties and desertion, while only about 3,000 new soldiers and police are recruited over the same period.Helmand is also close to fallen back into the hands of the Taliban.Taliban jihadists, which have a close relationship with al Qaeda and the Haqqani Network, controlled nearly 40 percent of Helmand\u2019s 13 districts as of March, including parts of the capital, The New York Times (NYT) learned from the Afghan security forces.In July, SIGAR determined that the the Afghan security forces were struggling \u201cto respond to the Taliban\u2019s growing national presence.\u201dBy August, nearly five months after the NYT report, the Taliban was launching attacks \u201con several fronts\u201d in Helmand and had seized control of \u201caround 80 percent of the province,\u201d doubling their control of the province, Kareem Atal, chief of Helmand\u2019s provincial council, told The Associated Press (AP).Despite investing nearly $70 billion in U.S. taxpayer funds on the ANDSF, the forces are still unable to \u201cproperly\u201d engage the Taliban on the battlefield, noted SIGAR at the of July.\u201cThere are a number of districts that the government claims are under their control, but the government is only present in the district administrative center and all around are under the control of the insurgents,\u201d said Atal, echoing a recent assessment by the U.S. Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A) of the situation across the country.At the end of July, USFOR-A suggested that nearly one-third of Afghanistan is either under insurgent control or influence, primarily the Taliban, or at risk of being so.In response to the chaos in Helmand, President Barack Obama deployed nearly 100 American troops in late August to the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah, said Brig.

You would have hundreds of thousands of people who are held as human shields,\u201d said Lise Grande, the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq.\u201cYou would have a chemical attack that would put tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands or maybe even more at grave risk. If all that were to happen at the same time it would be catastrophic,\u201d said Grande, noting that Islamic State has said it could use chemical weapons to defend the city.\u201cIn order to house and support and accommodate 1 million people at dignified standards we would be looking at an operation of $1 billion,\u201d she said.That is more than four times the $230 million the international body has received so far for the effort, funds which have only recently arrived.So far, a total of six camps have been built that can accommodate 50,000 people. Efforts are underway to construct 11 more, said Grande.Grande and Iraqi officials are hoping residents can stay home as long as possible to avoid being caught up in the crossfire once the shooting starts, and to avoid a mass exodus that would overwhelm relief efforts.Of the up to 1.5 million people believed to be in Mosul now, around 200,000 are expected to try and escape as Islamic State digs in for its most important fight.\u201cIf you were to see a forced population movement of more than 150,000 people, at that stage there isn\u2019t an institution in the world that could cope with that scale of movement,\u201d said Grande. \u201cWhat we are hoping is that the population movement is staggered. That it doesn\u2019t happen all at once.\u201dIslamic State swept into Mosul in 2014 with virtually no resistance from the Iraqi army. Its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared a caliphate and his followers took control, beheading or executing anyone suspected of opposing them.Mosul is a predominately Sunni city located in one of the most ethnically diverse parts of Iraq.Apart from the Iraqi army, an array of other forces aim to join in the battle against Islamic State, from Shi\u2019ite militias to the peshmerga security forces of Iraq\u2019s Kurdish autonomous region, to a Sunni force backed by Turkey.The wrong mix could deepen sectarian divisions after Mosul is attacked, risking all-out civil war and more hardship.Securing aid resources is difficult when much of the Middle East, especially Syria, is locked in war. There are already more than 3 million people displaced in Iraq in connection with conflicts with Islamic State.

Referring to herself as a \u201cJewish-American Columbia graduate, former-Fulbright scholar, the granddaughter of Holocaust refugees, lecturer, author, and activist for Palestinian rights,\u201d the campaign\u2019s Director of Organizing claims to have had an epiphany after going on a Birthright Israel trip during\u00a0which she was \u201cindoctrinated\u201d with pro-Israel views.However, Lee Kaplan of the Gatestone Institute performed\u00a0a background check in 2013 and couldn\u2019t verify any of her claims:According to my research, Anna Baltzer never went on a Birthright tour of Israel in the year 2000 or any other time. Inquiries to the New York and Israel offices to ascertain if she went with Birthright revealed absolutely no record of any Anna Baltzer attending the program ever, let alone in year 2000. In short, it seems that Anna Baltzer lied about her participation in Birthright to convey the false impression that she was once a loyal Jew who supported the Jewish homeland but had discovered the justification for Palestinians\u2019 goals to overthrow Israel.Further, after researching Ms. Baltzer\u2019s claims of being a Fulbright Scholar from Columbia in 2003, it has been determined from both Columbia\u2019s and the Fulbright websites, as well as Fulbright officials, that Anna Baltzer was never a Fulbright scholar either.It later emerged that Baltzer may have used her original name, Piller, on her Birthright trip (Baltzer being a made-up Jewish-sounding last name). But neither Piller nor Baltzer were listed as Fulbright scholars at any time from 1990 onwards.

The drone, which appeared to be one used for surveillance, was taken back to their outpost for examination and exploded while being taken apart.The Associated Press (AP) adds:A recently released video belonging to an al-Qaida offshoot, Jund al-Aqsa, purportedly shows a drone landing on Syrian military barracks. In another video , small explosives purportedly dropped by the Iran-backed Shiite militant group Hezbollah target the Sunni militant group Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, formerly known as the Nusra Front, near Aleppo. The technology is not new, but the videos are the first known demonstration of these capabilities by any militant groups\u2026A number of militant groups in the Middle East, including the Islamic State group, Jund al-Aqsa and Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, as well as Hezbollah and Hamas, have all released videos indicating that they have surveillance and reconnaissance drones. Syrian anti-government rebels and militias loyal to President Bashar Assad were also flying cheap quadcopters and hexacopters as early as 2014 to spy on one another.Hezbollah reportedly claims it has been using weaponized drones for two years.\u201cA \u00a0recent video of bomblets hitting a militant camp near the Syrian town of Hama is the first known documentation,\u201d notes AP.Chris Woods, the head of the Airwars project, which tracks the international air war in Iraq, Syria and Libya, told AP that \u201cthere are a million ways you can weaponize drones \u2014 fire rockets, strap things in and crash them.\u201d\u201cThis is the stuff everyone has been terrified about for years, and now it\u2019s a reality,\u201d he added.On Wednesday, the Pentagon acknowledged that French and Kurdish forces in northern Iraq have been attacked and seriously injured by an exploding drone.The attack added \u201ca new worry to the wars in Iraq and Syria as militant groups learn to weaponize their store-bought drones,\u201d reports AP.On Oct. 2, an IED was attached on a drone that exploded and killed two Kurds after it was taken back to their camp near the Iraqi city of Irbil, revealed Air Force Col. John Dorrian, the spokesman for the U.S.-led military coalition in Iraq.An unnamed U.S. official revealed \u201cthe drone looked like a Styrofoam model plane that was taped together in a very rudimentary style,\u201d reports AP, adding that \u201cit appeared to be carrying a C-4 charge and batteries, and may have had a timer on it.\u201dJihadists are using various forms of improvised and modified drones, but \u201cthere\u2019s nothing very high tech about them,\u201d said Col.

The meeting was expected to include foreign ministers from Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Iran.The U.S. State Department said Kerry had called for the meeting and would attend, but declined to say what foreign ministers other than Lavrov had been invited or would attend.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Washington remained committed to a \u201cdeep multilateral engagement\u201d to reduce the violence in Syria which would \u201cnecessarily\u201d involve Russia too.\u201cBut it is no longer in the context of trying to broker this agreement that would \u2026 hold out the prospect of U.S. military cooperation with Russia. That\u2019s something that Russia has lost\u2026 the credibility to be able to try to agree to,\u201d he said.On Wednesday, 25 people were killed by heavy air strikes on rebel-held areas of Aleppo, the Civil Defence, a rescue service working in rebel-held areas, said on Twitter, adding that 15 of them were killed at a market place in the Fardous district.The Syrian army has denied targeting civilians.AIR STRIKESA Syrian military source said warplanes had struck several locations to the south and southwest of Aleppo but Syrian and Russian officials could not immediately be reached to comment on the market place attack.It was the second day of heavy air strikes after a lull of several days which the Syrian army said was designed to allow civilians to leave.Rebels said the intensity of the air strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday had returned to the level seen at the start of the Russian-backed campaign to capture Aleppo.Moscow\u2019s intervention, which began just over a year ago, has tipped the scales back towards President Bashar al-Assad.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based organisation that reports on the war, said it had documented the deaths of 55 people killed in escalating bombardment of eastern Aleppo in the last 48 hours.The Observatory also reported that four people were killed in government-held areas by insurgent shelling.Clashes between pro-government and rebel forces were also reported in a rebel-held area in southern Aleppo.The war has killed more than 300,000 people, created the world\u2019s worst refugee crisis, allowed for the rise of Islamic State and drawn in regional and major powers.Assad aims to take back all of Aleppo, which was Syria\u2019s biggest city before the outbreak of war in 2011.The city has been divided between government and rebel control for years and food, water and medical supplies in rebel areas are now running low.Last Saturday Russia vetoed a French-drafted United Nations Security Council resolution that would have demanded an immediate end to air strikes and military flights over Aleppo.On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused France of deliberately luring Moscow into vetoing the resolution and suggested it was doing the bidding of the United States.\u201cWhat for? To exacerbate the situation and to whip up anti-Russian hysteria in media under their control, and to deceive their own citizens,\u201d Putin said, accusing France of serving U.S. domestic political interests.\u201cOBSTRUCTIVE ATTITUDE\u201dPutin later told France\u2019s TF1 television channel that the West, especially the United States, was responsible for Syria\u2019s plight and he dismissed the Western accusations of Russian and Syrian war crimes as \u201cpolitical rhetoric\u201d.French Prime Minister Manuel Valls faced criticism from opposition lawmakers over his government\u2019s handling of relations with Russia over Syria.\u201cRussia has chosen an obstructive attitude and from our point of view this stance is unjustifiable,\u201d Valls said after being asked by a parliamentarian why Paris was adopting a tough position on Russia.Despite the war of words, the Kremlin said Putin spoke to French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday and said he hoped Saturday\u2019s talks would be \u201cfruitful\u201d.France and Britain back a proposal for a dilution of big powers\u2019 United Nations vetoes in cases of serious war crimes, the top U.N. human rights official said in Geneva, but he gave little support to Syrian opposition hopes of strong-arming Russia over eastern Aleppo.Zeid Ra\u2019ad al Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said last week that Security Council veto powers should be curbed to help resolve the situation and bring Syria under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.The dispute over Aleppo has unfolded against a backdrop of separate campaigns being waged against Islamic State by a U.S.-led alliance and the Russian-backed Syrian army.As part of the fight against IS, Syrian rebels backed by Turkey are currently waging a campaign in northern Syria near the Turkish border.A rebel commander told Reuters the Turkey-backed forces had advanced closer to an Islamic State-held village that is of great symbolic significance to the group on Wednesday.The rebels captured the village of Duweibiq, which is some 2 km from Dabiq \u2013 the site of an apocalyptic prophecy central to the militant group\u2019s ideology. \u201cThe clashes were not very fierce but there is resistance,\u201d the commander said.", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 2:24 AM PDT", "title": "Kerry, Lavrov Want to Keep Talking About Syria Despite War Crimes Row", "tags": ["Big Government", "Breitbart Jerusalem", "National Security", "Aleppo", "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov", "Syria civil war", "syrian army", "Syrian Observatory for Human Rights", "U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry", "United Nations Security Council"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2016/10/13/kerry-lavrov-want-keep-talking-syria-despite-war-crimes-row/"}, {"id": "post-5257922", "author": "Breitbart Jerusalem", "content": "Start with Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s recent flat refusal to promise a US veto on any upcoming anti-Israel resolution in the UN Security Council.On Saturday, Haaretz reports, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Kerry he\u2019s counting on Washington to stick to its policy of nixing anti-Israel resolutions.

She said she attended a private Clinton fundraiser at the home of a local dentist, where she had an encounter with the Clintons and was directly approached by Hillary.In the video interview with this reporter, filmed in the presidential suite of the historic Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C,\u00a0 Broaddrick\u00a0explained that she was in possession of checks from donors to be delivered to Clinton\u2019s campaign as well as a list of potential donors.\u00a0 Broaddrick was a volunteer for Clinton\u2019s gubernatorial campaign.She says she went to the fundraiser about thirty minutes early in an attempt to avoid the Clintons.Instead, she says, Bill and Hillary Clinton arrived early, as well.She recounted during the interview:\u201cAnd they come in early from the kitchen area. And just before they do, a gentleman who had driven them from the airport comes straight over to me. He was supporting Clinton but he didn\u2019t know what had happened to me even though he was a friend.

He was arrested early Monday \u2014 nearly two days after he evaded officers during a raid on an apartment about 80 kilometers (50 miles) away where police found explosives.Though Saxony has been the heart of the anti-migrant group Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West, known by its German acronym PEGIDA, residents of the state\u2019s largest city were focused Tuesday on the actions of those who apprehended Albakr.\u201cI immediately thought: hats off to the guys who did that. It was dangerous, after all,\u201d said retiree Maria Haubold, dismissing the idea that refugees were a general threat to German society.\u201cThey come over here to live in peace and not to live through the same things they experienced at home, war and poverty,\u201d she said.Leipzig Mayor Burkhard Jung thanked the Syrians, whom authorities are not identifying out of concern they could become targets for retribution.\u201cA person who at first glance seems to have been obviously dangerous was held by fellow Syrians and handed over to the police. That\u2019s a very courageous act,\u201d Jung told The Associated Press.\u201cMany, many refugees are here because they are fleeing the fighters of the so-called Islamic State. That\u2019s worth remembering, and this story serves to emphasize that,\u201d he said.Albakr, who had been granted asylum in Germany, was among 890,000 migrants who arrived in the country last year, many of them from Syria.Worries over the difficulties of integrating large numbers of Muslim newcomers and over the possibility of radicalized migrants carrying out attacks have helped boost anti-foreigner sentiment in recent months.In July, several people were wounded in two attacks carried out by asylum-seekers and claimed by the Islamic State group; both assailants were killed.Andre Hahn, a prominent lawmaker with the opposition Left Party, told Bayerischer Rundfunk radio that the men who captured Albakr should be granted asylum as soon as possible in recognition of their courage.\u201cThat would be very important for all honest refugees who need help and who in their absolute majority have nothing to do with the self-styled Islamic State or any terrorist activities,\u201d Hahn said.The Syrians\u2019 asylum status wasn\u2019t immediately clear.Albakr met the men who eventually would turn him in after he fled the police raid on an apartment where he was staying in the city of Chemnitz and posted on an internet network for Syrian refugees that he was at Leipzig\u2019s main rail station and needed a place to stay, German newspaper Bild reported.One of the Syrians, identified only as Mohamed A., was quoted as telling the newspaper that he and a friend picked Albakr up and took him back to another friend\u2019s apartment, only later seeing police notices on Facebook about the bomb plot suspect.As Albakr slept on Sunday evening, they discussed with other Syrians on Facebook whether their guest was the fugitive, and then tied him up with electric cords.\u201cHe offered us 1,000 euros ($1,115) and $200 if we let him go. He had that in a backpack together with a knife,\u201d the man was quoted as saying. \u201cI am so grateful to Germany for taking us in. We could not allow him to do something to Germans.\u201dOn Tuesday nobody answered the door of the apartment in the modest social housing complex where Albakr was apprehended. Neighbors noted that Mohamed A.\u2019s shoes were missing and suggested that he might have been taken to a safe house by police before dawn, in part to evade the notice of TV crews.Bild columnist Franz Josef Wagner opened his second-page column Tuesday with the words \u201cDear Heroes.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how good your German is and whether you know our Constitution (women and men are equal, freedom of religion etc.),\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut beyond language and tradition, you know what good and bad are. That makes you friends.\u201dEven the nationalist, anti-migration Alternative for Germany party appeared relatively muted in its response to the Chemnitz case.Investigators think Albakr was considering Berlin\u2019s airports as potential targets. Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of the domestic intelligence agency, told ZDF television it received information in early September that the Islamic State group was planning \u201cattacks on infrastructure, stations and airports, in western Europe, particularly Germany.\u201dFollowing the \u201cabstract\u201d tip, Maassen said German authorities \u201cgenerated a lot of information ourselves, and exchanged a lot of information with partners, until we came to this name and this address.\u201dHe and other officials were tightlipped with details of Albakr\u2019s suspected contacts with IS, saying that is part of their ongoing investigation.\u201cFrom intelligence information, there are good reasons to say that he had relations with IS,\u201d Maassen said.", "date": "12 Oct 2016, 1:14 AM PDT", "title": "Syrians in Germany Who Tied up Bomb Suspect Hailed as Heroes", "tags": ["Breitbart Jerusalem", "Jihad", "National Security", "Alternative for Germany party", "German police", "Islamic State", "islamic terrorism", "Jaber Albakr", "jihad"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2016/10/12/syrians-germany-tied-bomb-suspect-hailed-heroes/"}, {"id": "post-5248882", "author": "Breitbart Jerusalem", "content": "\u201cThe United Nations\u2019 obsessive hostility towards Israel will be on display yet again this week as UNESCO considers another blatantly biased resolution that unjustly singles out our close ally Israel with false accusations and criticism, and attempts to erase the specific deep-rooted, historical connection of Jews and Christians to Jerusalem, Israel\u2019s eternal capital,\u201d Cruz\u2019s office said Tuesday.The Texas senator and Florida congresswoman were joined in their letter by 39 of their congressional colleagues.\u201cFor thousands of years, Jerusalm [sic] has played a defining, central role in the history and identity of the Jewish people,\u201d Cruz\u2019s office said. \u201cFor Christians, Jerusalem is a seminal spiritual site.

Breitbart Texas has reported about the substance of the charges, the parties and witnesses involved, and the re-indictments after special prosecutors asked for a dismissal of two indictments. The charges against the Texas Attorney General are felonies.The criminal case against Paxton is separate from the civil action for damages filed by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.As reported by Breitart Texas on October 7th, Judge Amos L. Mazzant, III (an Obama appointee) dismissed the civil securities fraud case against Paxton. He wrote in his order, \u201cThis case is not about whether Paxton had a moral obligation to disclose his financial\u00a0arrangement with Servergy to potential investors. This case is also not about whether Paxton had\u00a0some general obligation to disclose his financial arrangement to his investor group. The only\u00a0issue before the Court is to determine whether the facts as pleaded give rise to a plausible claim\u00a0under federal securities laws. With that limitation in mind, the Court has determined that under\u00a0the facts pleaded by the Commission, Paxton did not have a legal obligation to disclose his\u00a0financial arrangement.\u201d The judge conditionally dismissed the case saying he would allow the federal government to amend the complaint with additional facts if they find them. The government has until October 21 to amend the federal complaint.In the criminal case, lawyers for Paxton filed applications for writ of habeas corpus which have been denied in lower court and intermediate appellate proceedings. These writs were also the subject of the appeal denied at the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Houston lawyer Philip Hilder told Breitbart Texas\u00a0that the issues raised \u201cdid not go to the merits of guilt or innocence, rather to the timing of raising pre-trial issues not being ripe for decision.\u201dPaxton\u2019s lawyers had also challenged the formation of the grand jury that returned all three indictments.\u00a0They argued that the trial court judge,\u00a0Judge Chris Oldner acted beyond the scope of proper legal authority by asking potential grand jurors during the jury selection process for those who would be \u201cwilling to serve\u201d and \u201cvolunteer.\u201d The judge told potential grand jurors he wanted \u201cto save everybody a little time.\u201dCollin County Judge Chris Oldner, recused himself from the case on July 29, 2015, after his wife Cissy Collier Oldner, was reported to be communicating about the Paxton indictments that were still under court seal. As reported by Breitbart Texas, the alleged breach of grand jury secrecy by the judge resulted in his wife\u2019s discussing the grand jury\u2019s indictment with Susan Fletcher, a Collin County commissioner.Hilder\u00a0told Breitbart Texas at the time,\u00a0\u201cThese criminal charges came out of a specially-selected grand jury that allege a crime that does not even exist under law.\u201d Another legal argument made by Paxton\u2019s lawyers was that the statute under which Paxton was charged, i.e., the law that relates to allegedly acting as an unregistered investment adviser representative, was unconstitutionally vague and preempted by federal securities laws. They had also argued\u00a0that the intermediate appellate court in Dallas erred in holding that the statute under which Paxton was charged does not require a culpable mental state. They argued that the securities law statute requires a guilty mindstate if he was required to register and did not register, and that this issue could be procedurally through a pre-trial writ.\u00a0The intermediate appellate court found that this argument could not be brought by a\u00a0pre-trial writ of habeas corpus.In a statement received by Breitbart Texas from Paxton lawyer Dan Cogdell after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 denial of review, he said \u201cWe\u00a0are disappointed with the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 decision, but we stand ready to prove in state court what U.S. District Judge Mazzant told us in his dismissal last week\u2013that General Paxton did nothing wrong. The securities fraud allegations in the recently dismissed SEC case mirror those in the state criminal case. Moreover, the special prosecutors\u2019 burden of proof in the criminal case is far greater than that of the SEC case.\u201dSpecial prosecutors contend that the dismissal of the federal civil securities fraud case has no bearing on the state criminal court case. Legal experts have said this is not necessarily the case.A well-known Houston-based criminal defense lawyer,\u00a0Troy McKinney of Schneider and McKinney P.C.\u00a0told\u00a0the Houston Chronicle\u00a0that while the federal judge\u2019s dismissal of the civil case does not guarantee an identical conclusion of the criminal case, the dismissal by the federal judge shows \u201ca clear signal into the weaknesses\u201d of the criminal case.McKinney added, \u201cI think it\u2019s extremely hard to believe there could be a criminal offense when a civil court has already thrown out civil charges. Civil charges are much less severe, and if they can\u2019t even make that burden, it\u2019s hard to believe they could make a criminal case against him.\u201dA former SEC prosecutor, now criminal defense attorney John Teakell told The Dallas Morning News,\u00a0\u201cThe prosecutors are going to have to go back and question whether they can really prove something. What they\u2019ll really have to worry about is convincing a jury.\u201d Teakell noted that the burden of proof in a civil case is lower than the burden of the prosecution in a criminal case. He was reported to say that if the SEC did not have sufficient evidence to urge in its federal complaint, prosecutors in the state criminal court case probably would not have the evidence they need to secure a conviction.Brian Wice one of the special prosecutors appointed over Paxton\u2019s case responded to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeal\u2019s denial of review of Paxton\u2019s appeal, \u201cToday\u2019s ruling marks an end to Mr. Paxton\u2019s almost year-long attempt to avoid being judged by a jury of his peers. We look forward to going to trial and seeking justice on behalf of the people of Texas.\u201dAs reported by Breitbart Texas in April 2015,\u00a0Houston attorneys Kent Schaffer and Brian Wice were appointed to serve as Collin County Criminal District Attorneys\u00a0Pro Tem.\u00a0Texas State District Court Judge Scott J. Becker, Local Administrative Judge for Collin County, Texas, issued the Order as a result of the decision by the Collin County Criminal District Attorney to recuse himself.Brian Wice represented former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom Delay in the successful appeal of his conviction.\u00a0Wice also represented NFL player Adrian Peterson in a high-profile child abuse case along with attorney Rusty Hardin. Peterson pleaded no contest for spanking his son with a tree switch. Wice also serves as a legal analyst for KPRC-TV in Houston.Kent Schaffer has been a criminal defense lawyer for over 30 years and has represented business and political figures such as former Houston Mayor Fred Hofheinz, U.S. Congressman Craig Washington, Robert Allen Stanford, and a variety of entertainers and athletes. Schaffer\u00a0began his legal career as an investigator for the legendary criminal defense lawyer Richard \u201cRacehorse\u201d Haynes.Paxton pleaded not guilty to indictments that many have called a political witch-hunt, as\u00a0reported by Breitbart Texas.\u00a0The issue of whether Paxton had failed to register as an investment advisor representative was raised by Dan Branch, Paxton\u2019s opponent in the Republican Party primary for attorney general. Rep. Bryon Cook (R-Corsicana) and businessman Joel Hochberg are complaining witnesses in the indictments. Cook is chairman of the powerful State Affairs Committee and is said by opponents to be a close lieutenant to Speaker Joe Straus. Hochberg is a close business associate of Chairman Cook. Paxton ran against Straus as speaker before he was a Texas state senator.After Paxton beat Dan Branch in the primary runoff election, a left-of-center \u201cwatchdog\u201d group associated with requests for investigations and indictments against then-Governor Rick Perry, and former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom Delay,\u00a0asked\u00a0the Travis County District Attorney\u2019s Office to investigate then-Republican Party AG nominee Paxton. The executive director of Texans for Public Justice sent a letter to the Travis County DA asking for an investigation three months before the November 2014 elections.\u00a0The Austin-based nonprofit is funded by the Rockefeller Family Fund and a foundation whose top political recipient was reported to be the Ready for Hillary PAC.The case is being tried in Collin County, Texas.Lana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

Governor Dan Patrick, and House Speaker Joe Straus was sent on Wednesday to the embattled agency responsible for safeguarding and protecting children in the Lone Star State.The directive was sent to newly-appointed Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (TDFPS) Commissioner Henry \u201cHank\u201d Whitman, Jr.As reported by Breitbart Texas on October 5, the agency was suffering from more bad news after reports became public that during the last six months, almost 1,000 of the most at-risk children had not been checked by CPS employees every day. The figure is astounding, especially when these children have been placed in the \u201chighest priority\u201d category and are the ones at most risk for physical or sexual abuse.By Texas statute, Child Protective Services (CPS) employees are mandated to check up on these children within 24 to 72 hours of being reported. Thousands and thousands of children were left defenseless during these critical hours. Just in mid-September, over 14,000 children were left unchecked. 2,000 of these cases were emergencies and the most urgent cases.\u201cIt is critical that the Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) eliminate the backlog of children not seen within the statutory guidelines,\u201d the letter from the Texas Governor, Lt. Gov., and House Speaker reads. \u201cAction plans must be demanded from DFPS regional management in order to address the current situation and proactively prevent additional lapses in the required face-to-face visitations and interventions.\u201cWe are confident that the Texas Legislature will make judicious budgetary decisions in the 85th Legislative Session to address the ongoing resource needs for the future biennium. However, we must act now to protect our children who are in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\u201cTo that end, we are directing that you immediately initiate the following actions as a focused effort to apply expedient stop-gap measures to the problem while legislators prepare for and make funding decisions for the next biennium.\u201dThe following steps were mandated in order \u201cto eliminate the current backlog ahead of the 85th legislative session:\u201dIn April of this year,\u00a0Texas Governor Greg Abbott appointed Whitman, a former chief of the Texas Rangers, as the new Commissioner. The new commissioner was charged with heading an agency that had been the subject of problems, abuses, and overreach. The foster care system had been the subject of a scathing order from a federal judge after a class action suit had been filed. In 2013 and 2014, there had been an alarming number of children who had died while in foster care,\u00a0reported\u00a0Breitbart Texas.A\u00a0class action lawsuit was filed against CPS in December of 2014. As reported by Breitbart Texas, the lawsuit was filed by a New York advocacy group called Children\u2019s Rights. Among those seeking change at the agency\u2013roughly 12,000 children who were in long-term care in Texas.\u00a0Judge Janis Graham Jack ordered the State of Texas to reform the system and wrote in her opinion that the system was a place \u201cwhere rape, abuse, psychotropic medication and instability are the norm,\u201d as reported by the Dallas Morning News in December 2015.At the time, Breitbart Texas and other publications reported the dramatic numbers of children who were going unchecked in October, TDFPS spokesman\u00a0Patrick Crimmins told Breitbart Texas, \u201cSpecific to the problem of not seeing children when abuse reports are made, the key to seeing more kids is to get more workers in the field asap.

The dramatic spike appears to follow a trend that has seen hundreds of asylum seekers appearing at various other ports of entry demanding refugee status or asylum.\u00a0Breitbart Texas recently reported on hundreds of Africans immigrants who had been leveraging Mexico\u2019s immigration system in order to get to the ports of entry in Calexico and San Ysidro, California, and El Paso, Texas.One of the concerns brought up by law enforcement officials dealing with the wave of migrants is that their criminal databases only show if an individual has committed an offense in the United States. If their country of origin does not have an active alert for that individual, they are simply processed and moved along the system, an American official told Breitbart Texas. The sharp increase in asylum seekers has pushed authorities to begin moving the individuals to Nogales, Arizona for processing since the manpower and facilities in San Luis has been overwhelmed. A law enforcement official not authorized to speak to the media revealed to Breitbart Texas that some of the individuals from Haiti have disclosed to agents that they entered Mexico claiming to be from Congo in order to receive a special permit that allows them to travel through that country for 20 days. Breitbart Texas previously reported on the permit that is given to immigrants from countries that do not have diplomatic relations with Mexico.

Williams was charged after hanging up on a caller in March 2016 who was reporting a robbery, according to the criminal complaint.Houston police officers began investigating Williams in April after complaints were received from callers being hung up on by a 911 operator. HEC Director David Cutler and HEC Center Division Manager James Wheeler, provided documentation to Detective David Vasquez detailing Williams\u2019 history of hanging up on incoming callers seeking emergency assistance, court records revealed.The supervisors reported that Williams had an \u201cabnormally large number of \u2018short calls\u2019\u201d with a duration of 20 seconds or less. The HEC uses a system called MagIC to log all calls into the center. It records each call processed by the operators and can tell whether the call was disconnected by the caller or operator. The MagIC database report shows \u201cthousands of short calls\u201d that were attributed to Williams between October 2015 and March 2016. Williams began working for the HEC as a 911 operator in July 2014.Recordings from two separate incidents were provided to Houston police officers and the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office Public Integrity Division investigators. The calls were in reference to a March 12, 2016 call about a \u201cShooting/Robbery/Homicide; and a March 13, 2016 call in reference to a \u201cSpeeding Vehicle,\u201d the criminal complaint states.Williams received calls from two different numbers in connection with the March 12 robbery/homicide call. The first call was hung up on by the defendant immediately, the report shows. A second call came in from the same number about a minute and a half later. Williams reportedly answered this call normally. After the caller, with an \u201caccented voice\u201d said \u201cThis is a robbery,\u201d Williams is reported to have made an audible \u201csigh\u201d and terminated the call. About ten seconds later, she received another call from a different number. This call was taken by a different operator who took the call. The caller told that operator that a man \u201chad fired multiple [shots] during a robbery and people may be hurt,\u201d investigators said.Investigators later contacted that caller they had identified as Hau Li, who reported he had made the 911 calls and that he had initially been hung up on before reaching the operator that finally processed his call. Li said he had gone into a convenience store to purchase a lottery ticket and heard someone yell that a robbery was in progress. He said said he saw \u201ca guy with a gun.\u201d He said he heard 5-6 shots. Fearing for his life, he got in his car and drove away and began calling 911 for assistance.The March 13 call about the speeding vehicle actually came from an \u201cofficer.\u201d Williams received the call and reportedly answered normally. The caller said, \u201cThis is Officer Moten. I\u2019m driving on [I]-45 South right now and right now I am at \u2013.\u201d The call was disconnected by Williams, investigators stated. The system continued recording her terminal and recorded Williams\u2019 comments when she said, \u201cAin\u2019t nobody got time for this. For Real.\u201dA second call was received was received shortly after the first call disconnected. He reached another operator who took his information that he was reported people racing cars in the area. The area was a known racing area where people had been killed just two weeks before the call.Investigators spoke with Moten and learned he was a security officer. He had observed two people racing and called to report the dangerous behavior. He was afraid someone would get hurt, investigators stated in the affidavit. He said his first call was disconnected and that he called back a second time where he was able to complete his report.HPD investigators contacted Williams in June and conducted an interview. \u201cThe defendant admitted that she often hangs up on calls that have not been connected because she did not want to talk to anyone at that time.\u201dThe criminal complaint was filed on October 5. Williams was released on October 8 on a 1,000 bond, according to court records.Hua Li told KPRC about his calls for help from the 911 center.\u201cThey just said, \u2018This is 911. How can I help you?\u2019 I was trying to finish my sentence, and we got disconnected,\u201d Li told the local NBC affiliate. Expressing his frustration at the call center he said, \u201cNobody, nobody is going to help you. You\u2019re on your own.\u201dWilliams\u2019 arraignment is now scheduled for October 17 in Harris County Court at Law #4 where she will appear before Judge John Clinton, according to court records. The court records show that Williams has not yet hired an attorney. She faces two Class A misdemeanor charges of Interference with an Emergency Telephone Call. She could face up to one year in county jail and a fine up to $4,000 on each count, if convicted.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

That alone is huge. Bannon gets what we do, also huge.\u2014 Brandon Darby (@brandondarby) October 12, 2016As Breitbart Texas Director Brandon Darby has said in various interviews the past, one of the key strategies to take on cartels involves declaring them foreign terrorist organizations.\nHe\u2019s likely going to attempt to have several of the cartels declared as foreign terror orgs. At least two have crossed that line, IMO https://t.co/W5oRUE0hzS\u2014 Brandon Darby (@brandondarby) October 12, 2016\nAs a terrorist organization, the U.S. could go after the corrupt politicians that protect them, the banks that funnel their money and other entities that the criminal organizations rely on,\u201d Darby said during one interview with C-SPAN.You know my heart for people in northern Mexico and you know my ambition to destroy the cartels oppressing them. Just imagine if he wins. https://t.co/UEbRZ7werK\u2014 Brandon Darby (@brandondarby) October 12, 2016With many politicians in Mexico being surrogates for drug cartels, the corruption in Mexico has provided a safe haven for the entities in question. Some of those politicians, including governors, have been the target of criminal indictments in the U.S. for their role as cartel employees. Despite having outstanding warrants for their arrest, the officials have been able to live peacefully in Mexico since as Darby has also stated, FBI agents and other law enforcement officials have had their hands tied by the U.S. Department of State that will not let them pressure Mexico into turning over some of those fugitive politicians.\nIf helping victims of sex trafficking matters to you, you have no business voting for Hillary. Her State Dept. shackled FBI on cartels\u2014 Brandon Darby (@brandondarby) October 12, 2016\nBreitbart Texas\u2019 Cartel Chronicles has been reporting on how Mexican drug cartels like Los Zetas, Gulf Cartel or the Knights Templar/Familia Michoacana have stepped out of their role as drug kingpins and turned into sadistic terrorists linked to mass exterminations. One of the most dramatic cases deals with government officials in Coahuila who turned a blind eye while the Los Zetas cartel kidnapped, murdered and incinerated more than 300 victims from one rural community alone. Half of those victims were incinerated inside a state prison.These people are monsters. Ignoring them hurts human beings. https://t.co/r162WE9SeN\u2014 Brandon Darby (@brandondarby) October 12, 2016The Cartel Chronicles project has also reported how the Gulf Cartel incinerated hundreds of victims near the border city of Matamoros. Instead of carrying out an investigation, the Tamaulipas government covered-up the case, claiming that they could not tell the difference between human remains and animal bones.The brutality of Mexican cartels does not stay south of the border\u2013Breitbart Texas has reported extensively on some of the cartel crimes that have taken place on the U.S. side as well. Along border cities, law enforcement officials and politicians have worked to minimize the presence of Mexican drug cartels operating with almost complete impunity in the United States. One of the arguments often made by border politicians deals with the use of outdated statistics by the FBI that do not take into account the types of crimes relevant to border cities. Breitbart Texas has reported in the past as to how the FBI Uniform Crime Report focuses on some metrics such as murder, car theft, and rape but overlooks human trafficking, alien smuggling, drug trafficking, kidnapping, and other crimes relevant to drug cartels operating along the border. The UCR report also does not quantify crimes such as robberies; under the current metric, there is no difference between a suspect using a knife to steal a wallet versus a team of cartel gunmen storming a house in south Texas.Unlike other criminal organizations, drug cartels have branched out their operations to include human smuggling, trafficking, extortion, kidnapping and other violent crimes. During the summer of 2014, the Gulf Cartel made $38 million from human smuggling alone. The criminal organization took advantage of the weak border security in the area, as well as the current immigration system, to overwhelm the capabilities of authorities at the border.\nNo. The Zetas and Gulf routinely make more income from illegal immigration than from drugs. https://t.co/GUTzuulhzC\u2014 Brandon Darby (@brandondarby) October 12, 2016\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

It alleged Ahmed Mohamed\u2019s civil rights were violated after he brought a homemade clock device to school that resembled a hoax bomb, which\u00a0Breitbart Texas reported.

It stated:Irving ISD retained legal counsel to respond to a lawsuit filed by a former student. Today, legal counsel submitted preliminary motions seeking dismissal of the claims against the school district and its employee.\u00a0 Both Irving ISD and its employee deny that they violated the law in any way, and deny all allegations asserted in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.Because this matter is in litigation, Irving ISD officials will have no further comment at this time.

The military personnel had tracked the man to some of his hideouts in the southern parts of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. The executions credited to the Zetas leader were order on behalf of the Old School Zetas against members of the Cartel Del Noreste (CDN). As Breitbart Texas has been reporting for more than 11 months, the CDN and Old School Zetas have been at war over drug trafficking and distribution routes. A military investigation was aided by anonymous tipster who reported seeing groups of gunmen moving along rural roads. Authorities spotted a red sedan being used by Javier \u201cEl Shaggy\u201d Morales Valencia, one of the top leaders within the Los Zetas in charge of operations in Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Morales Valencia is a former police officer from the border state of Coahuila and is believed to be one of the men behind the ongoing executions in Ciudad Victoria. Sources in Nuevo Le\u00f3n identify El Shaggy under the alias Bravo 1, one of the names used in many narco-banners throughout Tamaulipas, however it remains unclear if other individuals also use the name.According to information provided to Breitbart Texas by Nuevo Le\u00f3n Attorney General\u2019s Office, El Shaggy was intercepted in the municipality of Allende, Nuevo Le\u00f3n along the highway that connects with the town Atongo de Abajo. Instead of giving up, the Los Zetas boss tried to fight off military forces. Mexican marines killed Morales Valencia and his aide Jorge Luis Contreras Lopez during the gun battle. Breitbart Texas obtained exclusive photographs from the shootout where Morales\u2019 body is seen near the body of his accomplice not far from their vehicle. Authorities found 10 bullet casings near the bodies.A Mexican Navy officer revealed to Breitbart Texas that Morales Valencia had been the target of a manhunt for several weeks since authorities believe he is tied to multiple executions in Ciudad Victoria, Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas\u00a0 and Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n. In addition to the executions, El Shaggy is believed to be behind the spread of multiple banners issued threats to rival cartel members. The manhunt was focused on the dirt roads between Linares and Allende, Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Breitbart Texas reported exclusively on the arrest of CDN leader Jose Francisco\u00a0 \u201cEl Kiki\u201d Trevi\u00f1o Chavez by agents from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in Houston, Texas. The CDN leader had been hiding in Texas after a sharp spike in violence in his territories.In the banners hung throughout Tamaulipas, the former cop Shaggy has been mentioned as the man in charge of \u201ccleaning the areas of rival drug peddlers and murdering rivals in their ongoing fight for territories. Another crime being investigated by state authorities is a grenade attack as part of an extortion scheme where a junk yard employee died and two others were injured. The attack took place on May 5 in the La Fe neighborhood in San Nicolas, Nuevo Leon.Editor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.\u00a0 The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.\u00a0Breitbart Texas\u2019 Cartel Chronicles\u00a0are published in both English and in their original\u00a0Spanish.

To further personalize her fight against the ruling allowing for super PACs to flourish, the Clinton camp produced a video for a dedicated page on her website to promote the position of getting \u201cunaccountable money out of our politics.\u201dThe Democrat nominee most recently brought the issue of needing to remove super PACs from the American electoral system in the second presidential debate against Donald Trump, according to The Wall Street Journal.Public positions against the use of super PAC organizations aside, recently-released emails and a campaign finance memo detail the lengths to which the campaign coordinated with Priorities USA with particular emphasis on sharing fundraising leads, joint donor relations efforts, and general communications. A memo penned by Clinton election counsel Marc Elias offered a scenario how a campaign staffer should properly share a donor lead to a super PAC fundraiser:Permissible: \u201cDonor A works in financial services and has been a long-time contributor. I think she\u2019d be willing to do six figures for Priorities.\u201dNot recommended: \u201cI want you to call Donor A and ask for $250,000.\u201dThe memo reminds Clinton staffers that if they are in a situation where they are raising funds on behalf of Priorities USA, \u201cthey must include a hard money ask (for $5,000 or less) during the course of the conversation.\u201dClinton attorneys stressed that communications between the campaign and PAC be limited to conversations involving fundraising and avoid topics related to polling, messaging or other strategic issues.A separate email thread indicating a Google Calendar invitation between key Clinton staffers and legal counsel reflected a March 7, 2016 conference titled \u201cSuper Pacs Check-In\u201d.

Palmer allegedly paid for a private safari to hunt the 13-year-old lion.\u00a0Zimbabwe wildlife officials said the group used food to lure Cecil out of the protected Hwange National Park. The lion was shot with an arrow but it took 40 hours to find him before they could finish him off with a gun. The lion was found decapitated and skinned.\u00a0Oxford University\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit had been studying Cecil for years. The lion had been tagged and regularly seen by tourists on safari.The media and public backlash was swift. Hollywood celebrities took to social media to condemn Cecil\u2019s killers. As reported by Breitbart, Sharon Osbourne, the wife of Ozzy Osbourne tweeted that Palmer was a \u201ckiller\u201d and called him \u201cSatan.\u201d The wife of the heavy metal singer who once bit the head off a bat added, \u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone could go to this man for dental services after this.\u201d Ricky Martin tweeted, \u201c#JusticeforCecilTheLion NOW.\u201d Nancy Sinatra tweeted, \u201cThanks for caring about #CecilTheLion, Jimmy.

Sullivan, who then served as Director of Policy Planning at Clinton\u2019s State Department, had forwarded a message from Clinton Advisor Daniel Kurtz-Phelan. The subject line of the unclassified message was \u201cAmerican guns killing American agents.\u201dThe email from Kurtz-Phelan to Sullivan said \u201cFYI, ATF announced last night that the gun used to kill the ICE agent in Mexico last month was purchased in the Dallas- area, by U.S.-based straw buyers. If this isn\u2019t on the Secretary\u2019s radar, it might be worth flagging it for her.\u201d The email went on with a block quote of an Associated Press article titled, \u201cATF: Gun in US Agent\u2019s Death Traced to Texas Man.\u201d Secretary Clinton\u2019s sole response to the email was to ask about the media ramifications of this revelation.ICE Agent Victor Avila was also wounded in the attack. Secretary Clinton did not inquire about the then current condition or status of Agent Avila or about Agent Zapata\u2019s family. She only inquired about press coverage of the report.In February 2012, Breitbart News\u2019 AWR Hawkins reported on the connection between the gun used to kill Agent Zapata and the Fast and Furious federal gun running program. He wrote:Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA) is looking into the DOJ\u2019s role in Agent Zapata\u2019s murder, and believes the weapon which was used came from a program similar to Fast and Furious. Which means that no one knows whether the gun-walking tied to Fast and Furious was ended, as Holder said it was, only to be started again under another program (with another name), or whether the gun walking tied to Fast and Furious simply continued longer than Holder claims it did.\u00a0And this brings the focus back to the head of the DOJ\u2019s criminal division, Lanny Breuer, \u201cwho\u00a0suggested\u00a0letting some illicit \u2018straw\u2019 weapons buyers in the U.S. [to]\u00a0transport their guns across the border into Mexico where they could be arrested.\u201d Was Breuer\u2019s suggestion adopted for Fast and Furious or was it adopted for another program that supplied the weapon with which Agent Zapata was killed?Congressman Issa appeared on Fox News on February 28, 2012, and said the DOJ was continuing to refuse to cooperate with the investigation by the House Oversight Committee. \u00a0\u201cI have told the Attorney General that it is contemptible, and I will seek, if necessary, contempt of the House, if we can\u2019t get cooperation under the constitution in our investigation,\u201d Issa said.Hawkins connected this murder with the murder of Border Patrol Agent Terry. Agent Terry was murdered just two months before the attack on Zapata and a gun connected to the Fast and Furious scandal was found at the scene.Breitbart\u2019s Mary Chastain wrote in October 2012 about an interview of Agent Avila\u2019s sister, Magdalena Avila-Villalobos by Univision. She presented the following as Agent Avila\u2019s own words about the attack:Agent Zapata and Agent Avila met with American consulate agents in Monterrey and received 14 boxes of equipment. They did stop for something to eat on road 57 before heading back to Mexico City. About a half hour after leaving the restaurant they noticed two cars closely following them. \u00a0Within seconds the vehicles surrounded them and 14 heavily armed men formed a circle around their car.Unfortunately, Agent Zapata put the car in park, which forced the doors to automatically open. Agent Avila said they thought their diplomatic plates would protect them and the screamed they were American agents. The men didn\u2019t care and demanded them to exit the vehicle.The agents refused to leave their vehicle. They frantically tried to relock the doors, but instead Agent Avila accidentally lowered his window. A rifle and handgun came in through the small opening and the man opened fire. Agent Avila pressed the emergency satellite button, but it did not work. He also tried to place an emergency call to the embassy, the Mexican capital, and the First Post of the Regional Security Command. They told Avila a Mexican Federal Police helicopter would be there in 40 minutes.90 bullets were fired. Five hit Agent Zapata and three hit Agent Avila in his right leg. Agent Zapata turned to Agent Avila and said, \u201cI am going to die.\u201d Agent Avila responded, \u201cNo, you are not going to die. Be strong, help is on the way, you are not going to die.While in the rescue helicopter Agent Avila was informed Agent Zapata did, in fact, die.In May 2016, Breitbart Texas\u2019 Legal Analyst Lana Shadwick wrote about the men facing trial for Zapata\u2019s murder and Avila\u2019s injuries:Twenty-eight-year-old Jesus Ivan Quezada Pi\u00f1a who goes by the alias \u201cLoco,\u201d and thirty-three-year-old Alfredo Gaston Mendoza Hernandez (a.k.a. \u201cCamaron\u201d and \u201cBurger\u201d), are facing four charges.The two men are facing trial for: murder of an officer or employee of the U.S.; attempted murder of an officer or employee of the U.S.; attempted murder of an internationally protected person; and using, carrying, brandishing and discharging a firearm during a crime of violence that caused a death.The men were extradited from Mexico and are still awaiting trial.Bob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

The 84-year-old Arpaio is on the ballot seeking a seventh term as sheriff.\u00a0The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) decided to charge Sheriff Arpaio with criminal contempt, according to AZCentral.\u00a0The sheriff did not attend the hearing.\u201cAmerica\u2019s toughest sheriff\u201d has been criticized by open border proponents for being tough on illegal aliens and illegal immigration. Maricopa County is approximately 80 miles from the Arizona-Mexico border where illegal immigration, criminal illegal aliens, human trafficking, sex trafficking, and drug trafficking endangers Arizona residents. The sheriff first took office in 1992 and while he has been reelected to an unprecedented six 4-year terms, open border proponents have worked very hard to stop him.Although official charges have not been filled, federal district court judge Susan Bolton at the hearing on Tuesday asked federal government lawyers to write a show cause order for her to sign. She set a deadline for Wednesday. Arpaio faces contempt for violating\u00a0orders in the racial-profiling case.As reported by AZCentral, DOJ attorney John Keller announced that the federal government will be investigating more allegations against the Arizona sheriff. He says that Arpaio and three employees will be investigated for obstruction of justice but Keller said the DOJ will not proceed with prosecution because they believe the statute of limitations prevents it. Judge Bolton was reported to say that she was not sure if that was the case and asked for a toll on the statute of limitations in order for the parties to research and discuss the issue.The Phoenix publication also reported that\u00a0federal district\u00a0Judge G. Murray Snow referred Arpaio, Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan, Capt.\u00a0Steve Bailey and defense attorney Michele Iafrate for criminal contempt charges. \u201cArpaio\u2019s charge stems from a December 2011 federal court order that barred his agency from enforcing federal immigration law. It is alleged that his deputies continued to do so, however, for at least 18 months thereafter,\u201d it reports.A tentative date for a jury trial on the criminal contempt charges has been set for December 6th.As reported by Breitbart Texas, Arpaio was sued by the ACLU, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), and a law firm that Eric H. Holder, Jr. works for. Holder was a partner at the firm for six years prior to his appointment as U.S. Attorney General, and Holder returned to the firm after he left his post as Attorney General. The law firm has been\u00a0reported as \u201ca key player in the opposition to Arizona\u2019s anti-illegal immigration law.\u201dArpaio has criticized Holder for among other things, how he handled Operation Fast and Furious, and for not being a supporter of peace officers. Holder was held in contempt of Congress in June 2012 over the ATF\u2019s Fast and Furious gun-running scandal. There were 255 House members who voted to hold the sitting Attorney General in contempt, including 17 Democrats. Holder and the DOJ would not comply with an October 2011 subpoena to turn over thousands of documents related to Operation Fast and Furious. Breitbart Texas has reported extensively about Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry who was slain in Arizona while on patrol. Two of the guns involved in the ambush were eventually tied to the Fast and Furious operation.\u00a0After two officers were shot execution-style in New York, Arpaio criticized New York Mayor Bill De Blasio and Attorney General Eric Holder.Arpaio has long been a critic and nemesis of President Obama. In June 2014, Breitbart TV\u00a0reported that Arpaio told NewsMax TV that he believes Obama intentionally caused the current crisis of thousands of unaccompanied minors flooding across the U.S.-Mexico border to force \u201cCongress to do something\u201d or \u201cshove some more executive orders down our throat.\u201dIn December 2014, Arpaio sued President Obama \u201cto stop the president from \u2018ramming\u2019 new immigration policies \u2018down the throats of the American people\u201d and asked a federal judge to issue an injunction blocking Obama\u2019s executive actions of \u201cblanket amnesty,\u201d as\u00a0reported by ABC News and all the major news outlets. Arpaio\u2019s lawyer, Larry Klayman, founder of the conservative organization Judicial Watch, told the judge in open court that Arpaio had been subject to bomb threats because of his public stance against\u00a0illegal immigration\u00a0and his promise to fight the president. As reported by Breitbart News in August 2015, Arpaio responded to a Washington, D.C. federal appeals court\u00a0judge throwing out\u00a0his lawsuit against Obama\u2019s executive actions by vowing \u201cwe\u2019re going to the Supreme Court.\u201dBreitbart Texas wrote an article in October 2015 entitled, \u201cLeft Media Just Can\u2019t Stop Trashing Sheriff Joe Arpaio \u2013 For Doing His Job.\u201d The piece noted, \u201cMainstream media, forever loyal to \u2018the fight,\u2019 has taken up the joint DOJ/ACLU effort and consistently delivers dehumanizing mockery and disrespect to the sheriff\u2019s plate.\u201d \u201cThe fight\u201d he writes, is the \u201cflow of millions of future Democratic Party voters.\u201dLana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

She said Chaz is very afraid now and does not want any near him.A police report has been filed with the Houston Police Department.

If the proposal passes, the city would be required to store the belongings of these homeless individuals for up to 90 days.The UK\u00a0Guardian notes that\u00a0Sequoia Capital chairman Michael Moritz, tech angel investor Ron Conway, and hedge-fund investor William Oberndorf have donated $49,999 apiece to Proposition Q.\u00a0Zachary Bogue \u2014 a tech investor and\u00a0Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer\u2019s husband \u2014 has reportedly also pitched in $2,500. The entire campaign chest for the proposal is approximately $270,000.Proposition\u00a0Q has faced criticism from those\u00a0who believe it is an attempt to punish the most vulnerable in order to relieve San Francisco of its most\u00a0visible symbol of its huge socioeconomic gap. The middle class is hardly visible and the growing inequity between the rich and the poor has become increasingly evident.Supervisor Mark Farrell, the author of Proposition\u00a0Q, wrote an op-ed on the issue\u00a0earlier this month, in which he said, \u201cI strongly believe that it is not compassionate to allow human beings to live on our city streets. Tent encampments are unhealthy and unsafe for the individuals residing in them and for our residents and businesses. Let\u2019s help get the homeless into housing, not tents; please vote yes on Proposition Q.\u201dOpponents disagree. \u201cWith Proposition Q, we\u2019re just taking away someone\u2019s tent and making them sleep on the cold concrete,\u201d Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness, told the\u00a0Guardian. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to disappear.\u201dFriedenbach reportedly argued that the campaign has nothing to do with homeless people. The Guardian notes that she believes it is\u00a0instead \u201ca tool being used by politicians looking to draw political distinctions in a one-party town.\u201dOpponents of the measure also note that Proposition Q does not include funding for additional housing or homeless shelters. That adds to the challenge when San Francisco\u2019s existing shelters are riddled with long waiting lists for people seeking beds to sleep on.The\u00a0San Francisco Chronicle, and a group of media outlets in the Bay Area, started a campaign this summer to\u00a0urge City Hall to address the city\u2019s homelessness problem.During a meeting with fellow Bay Area publications at the time,\u00a0the San Francisco Chronicle\u2019s Editor-in-Chief,\u00a0Audrey Cooper, said,\u00a0\u201cYou will not be able to log onto Facebook, turn on the radio, watch TV, read a newspaper, log onto Twitter without seeing a story about the causes and solutions to homelessness.\u201dFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope\u00a0@AdelleNaz", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 1:09 PM PDT", "title": "Rich Tech Investors Back Bid to Ban Homeless Camps From SF", "tags": ["Breitbart California", "Tech", "homeless encampments", "homeless tents", "marissa mayer", "Measure Q", "Michael Moritz", "Proposition Q", "Ron Conway", "san francisco", "Sequoia Capital", "William Oberndorf"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/10/13/wealthy-investors-back-bid-to-ban-homeless-camps-from-san-francisco/"}, {"id": "post-5261027", "author": "AWR Hawkins", "content": "In a video shot during the fundraiser, O\u2019Keefe asks Feingold, \u201cIf there\u2019s still Republican control in Congress, and if Hillary is elected, is there anything she can do could do to, uh\u2026\u201d.

The Register reports the DA\u2019s office says DaVinci charged \u201cmarked-up prices for shipping and processing\u201d as well.The report continues:According to the lawsuit, the companies hired sales and marketing staffers and pushed them to meet revenue goals through discount promotions such as \u201csummer sales\u201d and coupons; the products were advertised in catalogs, brochures and other materials.\u201cIt costs us roughly $25 per unit to manufacture, and we are selling from $170,\u201d one employee wrote in an email, according to the lawsuit.From 2009 to 2015, the companies collected $56,678 in \u201cpacking and handling\u201d fees marked up by roughly 50 percent over the actual cost of packaging and handling, according to the suit.Employees were paid a commission on profits they earned from the packing and handling charges, the lawsuit says.Some products were allegedly sold to different customers at different prices.\u201cThis case is not about whether it should be lawful to sell fetal parts, or whether fetal-tissue research is ethical or legal,\u201d said district attorney Tony Rackauckas. \u201cThis lawsuit is aimed at taking the profit out of selling body parts.\u201dMichael Tein, attorney for the DaVinci companies, said his clients have complied with regulations regarding fetal tissue and never made money off its sale.\u201cTheir scientists worked day and night to discover cell-based medical treatments and improve the quality of life for patients suffering from cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s and other deadly diseases,\u201d he said, according to the\u00a0Register.DaVinci Biosciences is owned by three members of the Isaias family \u2013 Andres, Luis, and Estefano. Two of them also own DV Biologics.The lawsuit comes following a year of congressional investigation into allegations that Planned Parenthood sold aborted fetal tissue and organs to biomedical companies for profit.While some of the focus of the allegations brought by pro-life organization Center for Medical Progress (CMP) has been on Planned Parenthood\u2019s relationship with tissue procurement company StemExpress, lead investigator at CMP David Daleiden alleged\u00a0in a statement that Planned Parenthood of Orange & San Bernardino Counties\u2019 (PPOSBC) is \u201clongtime baby body parts business partners\u201d with \u201csister companies DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics.\u201d\u201cFor eight years, Planned Parenthood supplied aborted baby hearts, lungs, brains, and intestines to DV Biologics, which DV Biologics then resold for profit,\u201d Daleiden continued. \u201cIn exchange for merely providing access to aborted baby body parts, Planned Parenthood received kickback contributions from DaVinci Biosciences over the course of their eight-year contract.\u201dHe added:The wheels of justice are beginning to turn against Planned Parenthood and their corrupt business partners in the illicit trade in aborted baby body parts. Planned Parenthood is not above the law, and law enforcement and elected representatives everywhere must now hold Planned Parenthood accountable for their barbaric profiteering off of pregnant women and the body parts of their aborted children.Deputy district attorney Kelly Ernby said the DaVinci companies previously had a contract with Planned Parenthood, but that the taxpayer-funded group is not part of the current investigation.The House Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives voted in September to hold biomedical company StemExpress in contempt for failing to provide documents required by congressional subpoena.The panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), issued the following statement regarding the criminal lawsuit against the DaVinci companies:For nearly a year, critics of this Panel\u2019s fact-finding investigation have repeatedly called for it to be disbanded, saying there\u2019s nothing to see here. They claimed there was no wrongdoing in the fetal tissue industry. This claim was soundly debunked with a lawsuit filed by Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas, which reveals that officials at the state and local level share our concern that some fetal tissue middlemen may have broken the law.Documents produced to the Panel show that, from 2008 through 2015, DaVinci Biosciences obtained its fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties (PPOSBC). DaVinci has told the Panel that PPOSBC \u201cdonated\u201d the fetal tissue. But DaVinci has also told the Panel that its executives contributed thousands of dollars to PPOSBC starting before the Planned Parenthood affiliate began \u201cdonating\u201d fetal tissue to DaVinci. Planned Parenthood has said PPOSBC was its only affiliate that gave fetal tissue directly to a research company.Blackburn said the panel\u2019s investigation shows the relationship between Planned Parenthood and DaVinci \u201cappears to have created a market for the donation of human fetal tissue.\u201d\u201cAs a result, our Panel is continuing to look at connections between Planned Parenthood and tissue procurement companies,\u201d she said.Pro-life leaders commended the Orange County DA\u2019s office for bringing the lawsuit.\u201cFor eight years, Planned Parenthood partnered with DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics in their grisly scheme to harvest and traffick the body parts of the babies Planned Parenthood aborted,\u201d said Lila Rose, president of pro-life organization Live Action, in a statement. She added:I commend the\u00a0Orange County district attorney,\u00a0and I hope this sets a precedent for prosecutors and law enforcement across the nation.\u00a0Abortion is a barbaric and cruel practice, and it should come as no surprise that those callous enough to profit off killing defenseless children in the womb would allegedly profit off selling their organs piecemeal.\u00a0It\u2019s time to end these grave human rights abuses against our most vulnerable children and bring those responsible to justice.Similarly, Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said,\u00a0\u201cThe Orange County, California District Attorney should be commended for suing two of Planned Parenthood\u2019s business partners, DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics, for profiting off of the body parts of aborted babies, sold to them by Planned Parenthood.\u201d\u201cHopefully this lawsuit is the beginning of the unraveling of the entire for-profit fetal tissue industry, one that Planned Parenthood has played a key role in for years,\u201d Hawkins added. \u201cIf a California District Attorney can file suit for illegally profiting off of baby body parts, there\u2019s no excuse for law enforcement in other parts of the country not to do their jobs and put a stop to this criminal activity.\u201d", "date": "13 Oct 2016, 11:01 AM PDT", "title": "DA Sues Two CA Companies for Profiting from Baby Parts from Abortions", "tags": ["Abortion", "Big Government", "Breitbart California", "Center for Medical Progress", "David Daleiden", "DaVinci Biosciences", "DV Biologics", "fetal tissue trafficking", "Orange County district attorney", "Planned Parenthood", "profit from fetal tissue sales", "sale of aborted baby parts"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/13/two-california-medical-companies-accused-profiting-aborted-fetal-tissue/"}, {"id": "post-5260177", "author": "AWR Hawkins", "content": "Such an increase \u201ctranslates to about one gun sold for every two residents in the county.\u201dAccording to The Sacramento Bee, two out of every three guns purchased during this 406\u00a0percent\u00a0increase have been handguns, which signifies self-defense and concealed carry as motivations.Fear of government overreach has also been a motivator.

About 30 percent of iPhone buyers are choosing to purchase the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus model, versus just 22 percent that chose to purchase the iPhone 6S Plus.Some analysts were already moving up profit forecasts before the Note 7 withdrawal, in expectation that iPhone\u2019s average selling price could hit an all-time-high of $700 per unit in the September through December quarter.Apple is undoubtedly benefiting from Samsung\u2019s pain. But with Samsung mobile devices running on Google\u2019s Android operating system, the potential big winner could be Google\u2019s new flagship Pixel XL smartphone.The Pixel XL will be very attractive to professionals who have embraced a slew of high-end analytics programs originally developed for Note phablet users.The Pixel XL is a beauty to hold and supports the same standard USB Type-C featured by the Note 7. Pixel XL also sports faster transfer speeds and better Android compatibility than the Note 7.No competitor can match Samsung IP68 rating for resistance to water and dust contamination, but iPhone 7 Plus gets a superior IP67, while Pixel XL gets a respectable IP53.The Note 7 had a slightly larger 5.7-inch screen with a Super AMOLED panel, versus a Pixel XL\u2019s 5.5-inch AMOLED display. Both have similar 2560\u00d71440 resolution.Pixel XL features a slightly more powerful Snapdragon 821 processor with 4 GB of RAM, compared to the Note 7\u2019s Exynos 8890 processor and equivalent RAM. Pixel XL offers internal storage up to 128 GB, versus Note 7\u2019s 64 GB version. But Pixel does not offer expandable storage support, while the Note 7 could take microSD cards.The Pixel XL\u2019s top attribute versus both iPhone 7 Plus and Note 7, is a 12.3 MP camera that provides the highest light intake, super fast laser auto-focus, an f/2.0 aperture, and it supports superior slow motion to full 4K video capture.Both the Note 7 and Pixel XL feature superior battery ratings of about 23 hours on a charge. That is about 10 percent higher than iPhone 7 Plus, which offers about 21 hours on a charge. All three smartphones support fast-charging capabilities.Apple was already the fashion pony for the phablet field by offering a wider range of colors, including Jet Black, Black, Rose Gold, Gold, and Space Gray. That topped Galaxy Note 7\u2019s Silver, Gold Platinum, Blue Coral, and Black Onyx, while Pixel XL only comes in Very Silver, Quite Black, and Really Blue.The latest updates regarding the cancellation of the Galaxy Note 7 are available on Samsung\u2019s corporate website.", "date": "12 Oct 2016, 9:30 PM PDT", "title": "Apple, Google Battle for 8 Million Cancelled Samsung Note 7 Sales", "tags": ["Breitbart California", "Economics", "Tech", "Android", "Apple", "Galaxy Note 7", "IP Code", "iPhone 7 Plus", "phablet", "Pixel XL", "Samsung", "smartphones"], "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/10/12/apple-google-battle-8-million-cancelled-samsung-note-7-sales/"}, {"id": "post-5255302", "author": "AWR Hawkins", "content": "The commission also said there needs to be an\u00a0\u201cincrease [in] the number of\u00a0staff who review how officers use less serious force, such as less-lethal weapons or punches, to take someone into custody.\u201d The argument behind new requirements for less-lethal force is that such force is used more often than lethal.According to the Los Angeles Times, the commission also wants the LAPD to increase the amount of information released when an officer-involved shooting occurs.\u201d\u00a0Commissioner Sandra Figueroa-Villa said, \u201cAfter a shooting occurs, there are often questions from the community \u2014\u00a0and rightfully so \u2014\u00a0about what happened and whether the shooting was necessary.

The union\u2019s board of directors released a statement, saying, \u201cThe commission has become nothing more than a group of pandering apologists in support of misinformed professional protesters. These latest batch of proposals are more of the same, solutions in search of a problem.\u201dBreitbart News reported that Chicago Police Department officials proposed new use of force restrictions on October 7, including a requirement that officers consider the race of the suspect before drawing their guns. A female Chicago officer was beaten to the point of hospitalization two days before the new proposals were issued. She described thinking she was going to be killed, yet she refused to draw her gun for fear of a public backlash.As in LA, the union representing Chicago police officers was not pleased with the proposals. The New York Times quoted union president Dean Angelo Sr. saying:At the end of the day, when an officer is confronted in that alley or an officer is confronted in a life-or-death situation, they are going to do what they is necessary to go home. If they getting written up for it, so be it.

Pollak", "content": "Ryan irritated pro-Trump Republicans while renewing\u00a0a bad news cycle that Trump\u2019s strong debate performance on Sunday might have otherwise ended, probably to the benefit of nervous down-ticket candidates.But Ryan also gave Trump something new: clarity.Trump is now free to run against Washington as a whole, which is likely what he meant by tweeting Tuesday morning that \u201cthe shackles have been taken off me.\u201dTrump won the primary by attacking both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 which is precisely how much of the electorate feels. As he moved closer to\u00a0the nomination, he had to\u00a0tone down some of his attacks.He is now free to renew them \u2014 and they may work, provided he retains the message discipline he has learned (somewhat) along the way.There are some exceptions. Trump remains on friendly terms with Reince Priebus and the Republican National Committee (RNC). Trump obeys a simple principle\u00a0in his relationships: he is friendly to those who are friendly to him, and nasty to those who are not, until they recant. (He seems willing to apply that rule to foreign policy as well, which is why he has not yet shown the requisite outrage towards Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.) He will not attack the party as a whole.Yet he will run against its leadership\u00a0\u2014 and he has no other choice, because the Republican Party will not be unified before November (if ever). He has to pull votes from the disaffected, and from Democrats.The simple truth of American politics is that while Republicans have better, and more popular, policies, they have a terrible brand. That is why Trump was able to lap the field in the primary.The question is whether Trump\u2019s own brand,\u00a0battered\u00a0by the political contest, is still any better.Strip away the daily news cycle, and the 2016 presidential election boils down to the following choice. Hillary Clinton offers a\u00a0status quo that voters know is corrupt, and incapable of grappling with the country\u2019s challenges, both internal and external, but which might be just stable enough to stave off disaster for long enough for better leaders to emerge.Donald Trump offers a shakeup that is\u00a0high-risk, high-reward: it could lead to making America great again,\u00a0but it could also lead to greater\u00a0chaos.To win, Trump has to minimize his own risk profile while making the status quo as intolerable as possible. The Republican leadership represents that status quo, even though\u00a0every single Republican in high office in Congress owes his position to a revolt against Washington that\u00a0stretches across three elections. They promised to change the system, and they barely tried.Ryan has given Trump a target, however inadvertently. Trump\u2019s\u00a0challenge is to convince voters he is an acceptable alternative.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

And there was no argument until then that localities, and states, and the federal government had a right\u2013as we do with every amendment\u2013to impose reasonable regulations.Stephanopoulos followed up, pressing her to give a direct answer as to whether the right to bear arms is constitutional. Clinton said, \u201cIf it is a constitutional right, then it\u2013like every constitutional right\u2013is subject to reasonable regulation.\u201dAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Republicans took heart in 2012 when challenger Mitt Romney handily defeated President Barack Obama in their first debate. But the Obama campaign\u2019s data mining team claimed to have the election in the bag already, and Romney\u2019s poor performance in the remaining debates may simply have sealed his defeat.Still, Trump\u2019s strong showing on Sunday left a far different impression than Romney\u2019s performance in the second debate in 2012, when he yielded to Obama and moderator Candy Crowley on the Benghazi issue.The Las Vegas debate will be the candidates\u2019 last chance to make a strong impression on voters on a national stage.
